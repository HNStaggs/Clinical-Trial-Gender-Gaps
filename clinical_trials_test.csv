This strategy is particularly suitable for prostate cancer where tumor hypoxia plays a major role in the resistance of these tumors to radiation.

In order to develop intratumoral hypoxia targeting by radiotherapy dose-painting areas, we should characterize changes in hypoxia before treatment and during radiotherapy.

* If hypoxia does not change during radiotherapy, radiotherapy dose-painting strategy by an ""integrated"" boost is performed.
* If hypoxia varied (increasing or incomplete regression), a ""final"" boost strategy of radiotherapy dose-painting(IMRT, stereotactic brachytherapy or high dose rate) after a first fractionated IMRT could be considered.

* Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection of the lining of the cervix with some kinds of human papillomaviruses (HPV). These HPV infections are distantly related to the viruses that cause warts on the skin. Like common wart viruses, most women who have cervical infections with HPV resolve the infections within 2 years without any need for treatment. Cervical infections that do not go away may cause disease that can turn into cancer after many years.
* Only one study has been done in Nigeria to learn how many women have HPV infection. The results of the study differed from most other studies in the world because older women were much more likely to be infected. This study with learn whether the results found in the previous study are true in Irun also, the site of the current study.

Objectives:

* To examine the age distribution of HPV infection and relationship to cancer of the cervix among Nigerian women.
* To understand how different screening methods, including HPV testing, could best reduce the risk of cervical cancer in Nigerian women.

Eligibility:

- Women residing in Irun, Nigeria, who are 15 years of age or older.

Design:

* Participants complete a brief questionnaire related to demographics, household and living conditions and a longer survey with questions related to reproductive history, family history, illnesses, stressful life events and sexual history (U. of Michigan collaboration).
* Participants have a cervical examination, HPV test, Pap test and blood test.
* Women whose tests show they are infected with HPV or have cervical disease will do the following:
* see a doctor and have cervical biopsies of all white abnormal areas (removal of a small tissue sample from the cervix)
* have photographs of the cervix taken
* have a cervical scraping for a new kind of HPV test.
* Some women with normal test results are also asked to see a doctor to check the validity of the testing
* Women with cervical disease receive treatment by a specialist and remain in the program until treatment is successfully completed or a final diagnosis is reached.
* Participants may be contacted for followup up to 5 years after the final diagnosis is made.",1466,FEMALE,30 Years,49 Years

NCT05512065,['Labor Pain'],2024-03-30,"Combined spinal-epidural (CSE) for labor analgesia has been used for many years and is practiced commonly at our institution, especially when the patient requests immediate pain relief. CSE is not only beneficial for its faster onset of analgesia, but also it is favorable in relation to the need for rescue analgesia, urinary retention, and rate of instrumental delivery compared to the traditional epidural. Despite its beneficial effects, there is a risk of about 15-30% of developing abnormal fetal heart rate following CSE. This is self-resolving with minimal or no intervention. Although the cause of fetal bradycardia is not fully elucidated, variations in uterine artery blood flow after epidural analgesia are thought to be due to the interaction of numerous events related to blockade of sympathetic innervations, fluid administration, maternal hypotension, uterine vascular effects of sympathetic block, fluctuations in circulating catecholamines, and possibly the effect of opioids. Similar mechanism is thought to be a cause of fetal bradycardia after the CSE with its faster onset and superior block.

Maternal or fetal circulation during labor can be assessed using continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound to monitor maternal uterine artery (UtA) and fetal umbilical artery (UmA) velocity waveforms to detect changes in blood flow. The velocimetry indices mentioned above have been often used to assess the changes in the blood flow before and after the induction of epidural analgesia during labor in several studies. Although there are some studies regarding the effect of labor epidural analgesia using velocimetry indices, but there is currently no published study evaluating velocimetry indices of uterine and umbilical arteries before and after the induction of CSE. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of CSE to maternal and fetal blood flow to evaluate the relationships.

NCT03160365,['Prostate Cancer'],2021-05-25,"A key feature of low-dose brachytherapy is that irradiation affects only a local area around the inserted radiation sources. The exposure of healthy tissues around these sources is then reduced. However, the number of adverse events remains high (about 79% of patients with sexual problems and 30% of patients with urinary incontinence) and brachytherapy is no better than other treatment options for Preservation of the urethral apparatus (about 40% of patients).

The current technique for the implantation of radioactive sources, which has not been revised since the early 1980s, consists in imaging the prostate at the beginning of the intraoperative procedure with transrectal ultrasound in order to evaluate the size and shape of the prostate . This information is then used to identify the best distribution of the dose of radiation to be administered to each patient. This treatment planning step is based on a procedure where the operator manually places 50 to 100 grains of iodine in the prostate. These grains are inserted transperinally under transrectal 2D ultrasound control, using needles through a transperineal grid with several needle guides evenly spaced 5 mm apart. This is an arduous task because this manual grain placement procedure must take into account the dose to be administered to the prostate without exceeding the dose limit for the surrounding organs at risk (rectum, urethra). In addition, the overestimation of the dose formality called TG-43 and the inaccurate grain placement can contribute to the creation of cold spots where no dose is administered. It may be responsible for recurrences of prostate cancer after brachytherapy treatment. Although brachytherapy dosimetry has been extensively researched, the TG-43 dose formalism has been the benchmark for the last 20 years. Moreover, from an economic point of view, the high side-effects rates of the treatment of prostate cancer result in particularly expensive post-treatment costs. The search for improved solutions for the treatment of prostate cancer remains a major societal challenge.

In recent years, a very attractive therapeutic alternative between active surveillance and overall treatment is gaining popularity among experts: focal therapy.

It is a localized treatment, limited to cancerous areas, in order to preserve healthy functional tissues inside and outside the organ and thus the quality of life of the patient.

Focal therapy is also often the preferred solution for recovery therapy (second intervention).

Finally, focal therapy has great potential to reduce the cost and duration of the intervention, as well as the cost of follow-up.

In recent years, several energies have been proposed as being adapted to focal therapy, such as high intensity focal ultrasound, laser ablation and cryotherapy. Brachytherapy, which already gives above average results in the treatment of whole glands, has been identified as a very good candidate for this new therapeutic paradigm.

In brachytherapy, radioactive grains are implanted in the prostate using transperineal catheters. The rapid reduction of the dose according to the distance of the radioactive seeds gives the physician a great flexibility to control the radiation accurately. It allows intermediate approaches between global and focal treatments, providing great scalability, and it is a good candidate for recovery therapy.

Recent studies have shown that focal brachytherapy allows more than half of the needles and seeds to act more strongly on the target while irradiating Significantly less The urethra and rectum.

Physiology of Glucose Kinetics']",2015-11-30,"Certain functional properties of cereal products, e.g. their postprandial glucose and insulin responses, have been characterized as steps towards obtaining a greater understanding of their beneficial health effects. A low-glycemic index diet results in decreased postprandial insulin and glucose responses, which is thought to be beneficial for insulin and glucose metabolism.

In healthy subjects, it has been shown that rye breads (RBs) produce a lower postprandial insulin response compared with refined wheat breads (RWB) despite similar glucose responses. Juntunen et al. (2003) suggested that the difference in the structural characteristics between rye and wheat breads is a possible explanatory mechanism. However, the underlying mechanism of this discrepancy between insulin and glucose responses to rye bread, the so-called ""rye factor"" (RF), is still largely unknown. Faster starch digestibility and higher postprandial insulin responses for RWB compared with RBs may indicate faster intestinal glucose absorption and faster glucose disappearance respectively.

Therefore our hypothesis is that despite having similar glucose responses, RWB has faster turn over (kinetics) compared with RBs. The present study is aiming to apply an experimental set up which can comprehend the hypothetical differences in RWB and RBs kinetics.",10,MALE,18 Years,40 Years

It is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal (death, eclampsia, abruptio placenta, HELLP syndrome) and perinatal (perinatal death, growth restriction, prematurity) outcomes. The only definite treatment of PE remains pregnancy termination. Therefore, prevention of PE remains an important challenge. Low dose aspirin may be used in the prevention of PE, particularly in women who had a severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks. Its efficiency, however, is very weak.

NCT00812526,['Autoregulation'],2004-09,"Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure. For a long time it had been assumed that the choroid is a strictly passive vascular bed, which shows no autoregulation. However, recently several groups have identified some autoregulatory capacity of the choroid. Choroidal autoregulation was first shown in a rabbit model where intraocular pressure (IOP) and arterial blood pressure could be varied independently. In these experiments regulation of choroidal blood flow was not only dependent on ocular perfusion pressure, but was also dependent on the value of IOP. This indicates that a myogenic mechanism contributes to choroidal autoregulation, because the regulatory capacity is dependent on the transmural pressure. In the model of myogenic autoregulation arterioles change their vascular tone depending on the pressure inside the vessel and outside the vessel. The present experiments are designed to test whether a myogenic mechanism may also be involved in choroidal autoregulation in humans. For this purpose the investigators perform experiments during which the IOP and the arterial blood pressure is increased. According to the myogenic theory of autoregulation one would expect stronger vasoconstriction at lower IOPs for the same increase in ocular perfusion pressure.",18,MALE,19 Years,35 Years

NCT00697957,['Osteoporosis'],2003-06,"Ageing populations have made osteoporosis and fragility fractures a major public health concern worldwide. Half of all women and 30% of all men will suffer a fracture related to osteoporosis during their lifetime. While medical prevention of this immense problem is impossible at population level, it is necessary to find efficient preventive strategies. Exercise is one of the major prevention approaches because one reason behind the increasing burden of osteoporosis is the modern sedentary lifestyle. However, the optimal type, intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise that best enhances skeletal integrity are still largely unknown.

We conducted a 12-month population-based randomized controlled exercise intervention in 120 premenopausal women. The aim was to investigate the effect of impact exercise on bone mineral density, geometry and metabolism in healthy women with the intention of assessing the intensity and amount of impact loading with a novel accelerometer-based measurement device. Training effects on risk factors of osteoporotic fractures, physical performance and risk factors of cardiovascular diseases were also evaluated.

This study demonstrated that 12 months of regular impact exercise favoured bone formation, increased bone mineral density in weight-bearing bones, especially at the hip, and led to geometric adaptations by increasing periosteal circumference. Bone adaptations had a dose- and intensity-dependent relationship with measured impact loading. Changes in proximal femur were threshold-dependent, indicating the importance of high impacts exceeding acceleration of 4 g as an osteogenic stimulus. The number of impacts needed to achieve this stimulation was 60 per day. Impact exercise also had a favourable effect on physical performance and cardiorespiratory risk factors by increasing maximal oxygen uptake, dynamic leg strength and decreasing low-density lipoproteins and waist circumference. Changes were dose-dependent with impact loading at wide intensity range.

Bone adapts to impact loading through various mechanisms to ensure optimal bone strength. The number of impacts needed to achieve bone stimulation appeared to be 60 per day, comparable to the same number of daily jumps. If done on a regular basis, impact exercise may be an efficient and safe way of preventing osteoporosis.",120,FEMALE,35 Years,40 Years

From this perspective, notice the use of the Pilates method as an instrument of therapeutic exercise for the protection and promotion of health. However, despite being popularly performed, there is still no scientific evidence on the standardization of the use of the method and its progression to an adequate prescription of physical training. The objective is monitoring the progression of loads of a 12-week training among the basic, intermediate and advanced levels of the Pilates method through heart rate (HR), subjective exertion perception (PSE) and heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, analyzing the effect of the method on cardiorespiratory and autonomic parameters. 40 healthy men aged 18-36 will receive Pilates training for 12 weeks. After the initial assessment and familiarization with the method, the training period will begin totalizing 36 sessions for three months, where each class lasts approximately 1 hour. During the three months, the participants must pass through the three levels of training: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. During each session, the investigators will initially collect: psychological questionnaire, visual analogue pain scale (VAS), and cardiorespiratory parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HR, respiratory rate and partial oxygen saturation). Throughout the session a heart rate meter will be positioned on the chest of the participant to capture HR, which will occur every five minutes together with the PSE illustrated in the model proposed by Borg. At the end of each session, the cardiorespiratory parameters will be collected again. In addition, cardiorespiratory parameters and HRV will be analyzed at baseline and after three months of training. In the case of HRV analysis, linear methods in the time and frequency domain will be verified. For the statistical analysis of the cardiorespiratory and autonomic parameters in the pre and post training moments will be used paired t test for normal data or Wilcoxon test for non normal data. For the analysis of the training load will be used the correlation of Pearson or Sperman according to normality.

NCT04587726,"['Body Image', 'Eating Disorder Symptom']",2021-05-28,"Body image is one of the leading concerns for young people. These concerns may can have serious consequences, including anxiety, depression, risk taking behaviours, eating disorders and suicidal ideation.

An extensive body of research highlights the negative effects associated with viewing idealistic media among adolescents. More recently, research has looked at harnessing media and technology to develop and disseminate material that counteracts these harmful effects. Using 'edutainment' (entertainment with educational content) to develop and disseminate interventions is a novel avenue of research. Micro-interventions (brief, low intensity, self-administered interventions), offer an alternative to traditional, intense interventions that may be unsuitable for milder concerns. Body image micro-interventions have proven effective at providing immediate and short-term improvements in body image among women. To date, body image micro-interventions have been focused on adult samples, with little research exploring how this intervention model may cater to adolescents.

The aim of the present study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a brief body image video micro-intervention to improve body image and acceptance of appearance diversity among girls, in addition to appearance-related internalised racism among the Black subgroup of girls.

The body image video micro-intervention is a 3-minute episode from Girls Room; a mini-series developed to address risk factors for body image. The series was developed through a collaboration between Lena Waithe, Dove (Unilever) and the Centre for Appearance.

The comparison control group will watch a 3-minute episode from an equivalent popular series which does not contain any appearance-related content.

In addition to the outcomes of interest, post-video acceptability checks will also be assessed to determine viewers' enjoyment, engagement, and identification with the video, as well as their intent to re-engage and share.

To undertake this project, 1848 adolescent girls will be recruited via an external research agency. Female-identifying North American citizens, aged 12-18 years old will be recruited, stratified to include 50% Black and 50% non-Black adolescents. The participants will be randomised to watch either the Girls Room episode, or control episode, at either 25%, 50% or 100% length of exposure. Before watching the video, they will complete baseline measures of demographics, state body satisfaction, acceptance of diversity of appearance, and appearance-related internalised racism (Black girls only). They will then be exposed to the video, before completing the measures again (post-exposure), along with acceptability checks.

Periods of immobilization result in a profound loss of muscle mass and strength. This loss of muscle mass can have negative effects on health and the ability to carry out activities of daily living. Thus, it is very important to try to maintain muscle mass during muscle disuse.

KRG has been shown to be effective in many diseases, such as cancers, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and sexual dysfunction. Several studies have indicated effects of ginseng on improving spermatogenesis in animals.

The FSN intervention targets parent feeding practices, young children's diet and physical activity (PA) and early childhood (0-2 years of age) weight status, all associated with risk for early childhood obesity and, consequently, risk for obesity over the life course. The investigators will also explore whether maternal psychosocial factors (stress, depression and substance use), household food/water security and/or constrained physical activity environments moderate FSN intervention impacts on: mother's feeding behaviors for infants and toddlers; and, children's diets, PA patterns, and weight status. Finally, the investigators will examine how maternal/infant characteristics, diet and behaviors impact the underlying biologic mechanisms of early childhood obesity and whether social and behavioral interventions can impact infant metabolic health. The investigators evaluation will employ a randomized controlled design, in which both the intervention and comparison condition receive assisted transportation to prenatal and well-baby visits (called ""Optimized Standard Care""), and the comparison condition also receives potentially beneficial injury prevention education at 8 assessment visits.

Efficacy of Family Spirit Nurture (FSN) + Optimized Standard Care (OSC) versus Injury Prevention Education (IPE) + OSC will be assessed for each of the following from birth to 24 months postpartum:

Aim 1. Mothers' implementation of recommended feeding behaviors. Hypothesis 1. FSN + OSC mothers will be more likely to meet breastfeeding and complementary feeding recommendations and engage in responsive parenting/feeding behaviors compared to IPE + OSC mothers.

Aim 2. Children's consumption of healthy diet and physical activity engagement. Hypothesis 2. FSN + OSC children will consume more fruits and vegetables and fewer calories from sugar sweetened beverages (SSB), snacks and desserts, and they will have higher physical activity and reduced screen time/other sedentary activities compared to IPE + OSC children.

The investigators propose that impairments in maternal self-regulation, which result in unsupportive parenting, directly impact children's own self-regulation and neurobiology, leading to risk for intergenerational transmission of mental illness. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a program that is targeted at improving underlying self-regulatory mechanisms in both mothers with depression and their 3- to 5-year-old children. It is hypothesized that children exposed to maternal mental illness will have greater self-regulatory deficits across emotional and behavioural domains compared to children not exposed to mental illness. The effects of maternal mental illness are expected to be compounded for children of mothers reporting a higher degree of chronic stressors, including poverty, housing instability, violence, and low social support. Further, it is hypothesized that taking a dual-generation intervention approach to addressing self-regulatory mechanisms underlying psychopathology at the level of the mother, child, and dyad (i.e. parenting interactions) will improve both maternal capacities and child outcomes.

NCT01220765,['Alveolar Hypoventilation Resulting in Hypoxemia'],2011-02,"Rationale: The current standard of respiratory monitoring for patients during deep sedation is continuous pulse oximetry with visual assessment of the patient. Clinical research has demonstrated that depressed respiratory activity is a principal risk factor for hypoxemia during sedation. Capnography may provide early detection of alveolar hypoventilation before hypoxemia has occurred in nonintubated patients and thereby improve patient safety during sedation.

Objective: At the Centre for Contraception, Sexuality and Abortion Leiden, abortion procedures are performed under deep sedation using propofol. Patient's monitoring is performed by nurses qualified in patient sedation management, using pulse oximetry and their clinical judgement. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of capnography in early detection of alveolar hypoventilation during deep sedation in comparison to standard monitoring with pulse oximetry in abortion procedures.

Study design: This protocol describes a prospective, open, randomized controlled trial with two study arms. All patients receive standard care of monitoring performed by the medical staff. The study investigates whether capnography prevents patients from having respiratory events during deep sedation in abortion procedures by early detection and therapy. Patients randomized to the standard care group receive standard of respiratory monitoring using pulse oximetry. In the capnography arm, respiratory monitoring is performed with pulse oximetry and capnography.

Study population: The study population comprises female patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing abortion procedures during first or second trimester pregnancies. Abortion procedures are performed until 22 weeks of gestational age.

Capnography: In addition application of capnography during deep sedation with propofol is performed. Before the trial starts, all nurses qualified in patient sedation management and abortion doctors will be trained in assessment of capnography. In the capnography arm, patients' breathing is additionally monitored with capnography. If alveolar hypoventilation is detected medical staff will intervene by arousing the patient, performing chin lift, repositioning the head, provision of oxygen, or abandon from giving additional propofol. These interventions represent the standard of care currently used by the clinical staff to respond to hypoventilation and hypoxemia.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is the occurrence of oxygen saturations to ≤90% in the population, as measured by continuous pulse oximetry. Secondary study outcomes include occurrence of oxygen saturations \< 80%, dose of administered propofol, arousal or movement of the patient during the procedure, airway interventions, early termination of the procedure due to respiratory problems, episodes of bradycardia, and administration of atropine.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The risks related to the conduct of this study are negligible and the burden minimal. Patients in both groups receive the current standard of care. Patients randomized in the capnography group could get benefit from the addition of capnography to the monitoring by early detection of alveolar hypoventilation. Capnography is a noninvasive measurement by means of a cannula under the nose, which before the sedation may tickle, but during sedation no inconvenience is expected.",440,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

NCT01848665,"['Healthy Males', 'Neuromuscular Function']",2015-06,"Increased core temperature (hyperthermia) has been associated with impaired neuromuscular performance; however, the mechanisms associated with these performance decrements and their potential synergies remain unclear. While the majority of research suggests that the observed fatigue is related to the central nervous system, the influence of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and associated changes in cerebral alkalosis (estimated by end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide; PETCO2) remains unexamined. In response to hyperthermia, humans hyperventilate as means of heat dissipation, resulting in a hypocapnia (reduced PETCO2) mediated decrease in CBF and consequently, cerebral alkalosis (increased cerebral pH). Previous research suggests that hyperventilation induces changes in neural excitability and synaptic transmission; however, it remains unclear if these changes are related to hypocapnia mediated decrease in CBF or decreased PETCO2 or both.

The purpose of the proposed research program is to examine the influence of changes in CBF and cerebral alkalosis on neuromuscular function during passive heat stress.

The need for a systematic ultrasound evaluation at the last weeks of a low-risk pregnancy and the best time to perform it remains controversial. The most commonly used clinical screening tool in this population is the serial measurement of symphysis-fundus distance, which is a method of a variable and low sensitivity for detection of FGR.

In Portugal, in accordance with guidelines of Direcção Geral de Saúde from 2015, fetal growth restriction screening in low risk pregnancies is performed with an ultrasound for fetal weight estimation at 30th-33rd weeks. Nonetheless, recent data from randomized trials showed that FGR detection rate was superior at 36 vs 32 weeks' gestation. In cases of severe FGR, detection rate was also superior at 36 vs 32 weeks' gestation. In a prior retrospective study, our group analyzed 1429 term low risk pregnancies and the investigators concluded that small for gestational age term babies (birthweight \< 10th centile) had a statistically significant higher rate of operative deliveries for intrapartum fetal distress than appropriate for gestational age as well as a higher rate of admission to neonatal intensive care unit. Moreover the investigators compared the same outcomes within small for gestational age neonates with antepartum detection at 30th-33rd weeks ultrasound vs undetected (normal 30th-33rd weeks ultrasound). Antepartum detection of small for gestational age neonates showed a statistically significant lower rate of operative deliveries for intrapartum fetal distress than undetected small for gestational age neonates. The investigators will conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial with the aim to evaluate if a 35th-37th weeks after the standard of care ultrasound in low risk pregnancies is effective in improving the detection rate of FGR and in reducing cesarean deliveries for intrapartum fetal distress and admission to neonatal intensive care unit.",1093,FEMALE,15 Years,45 Years

NCT01090765,"['Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer']",2014-04-01,"Background:

* Currently, there is no curative therapy for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), a leading cause of death in men. However, researchers are exploring new treatments that involve drugs that prevent angiogenesis (the process by which new blood vessels are formed) and can slow or prevent tumor growth.
* TRC105 is an experimental drug that blocks angiogenesis, and has been studied for possible use in treating different kinds of cancer. However, it has not been validated to treat prostate cancer in general or CRPC in particular.

Objectives:

* To determine the effects of TRC105 as a treatment for CRPC
* To determine the safety and effectiveness of TRC105 in treating CRPC

Eligibility:

- Men at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with castrate-resistant prostate cancer for which existing treatments have not been effective.

Design:

* Eligible individuals will have a series of blood and other tests to determine their suitability for participating in the study.
* Participants will receive intravenous infusions of TRC105 in a 28-day treatment cycle. Participants will receive i.v. (intravenous) infusions of TRC105 every two weeks on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (cohorts 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) and every week on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28 day cycle (cohort 4).
* Participants will receive different doses of TRC105 depending on when they enter the study, up to a maximum tolerated dose or optimum treatment dose.
* Frequent blood and urine tests will be performed during treatment, as well as other tests of cancer progression as directed by the study doctors. Participants will receive medicines to help prevent possible adverse side effects of TRC105, such as allergic reaction to the drug.
* Participants will continue treatment with TRC105 until they or the study team decides that the medication is not beneficial. No additional testing will be required unless participants discontinue the treatment because of side effects (which the study doctors will follow until the side effects are resolved).",21,MALE,18 Years,N/A

NCT02060474,['Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome'],2018-06-26,"This therapeutical trial will be conducted in patients with the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS), which is mutations in MCT8.

MCT8 is a thyroid hormone (TH) transporter which is crucial for the transport of TH from the blood into different tissues. Dysfunction of MCT8 results in a lack of TH (hypothyroidism) in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake. This local hypothyroidism in the brain of these patients causes severe psychomotor retardation.

In addition, TH serum parameters are highly abnormal in AHDS: high T3, low T4 and normal TSH levels. The high serum T3 levels cause local hyperthyroidism in tissues that do not depend on MCT8 for cellular transport of TH, resulting in a low body weight and reduced muscle mass.

Currently, no adequate treatment is available for the AHDS. A T3 analog that does not depend on MCT8 for its cellular entry could, at least partially, restore the abnormalities found in AHDS. Several in vivo, in vitro and animal studies have shown that the T3 analog Triac is a very promising candidate:

1. Triac binds to the same TH receptors as T3;
2. Cellular uptake of Triac does not depend on functional MCT8. Hence, in AHDS patients Triac will also be available in tissues that require functional MCT8 for TH uptake, e.g. the brain;
3. In vitro studies have shown that neuronal cells differentiate equally well in the presence of either Triac or T3;
4. In Mct8 deficient mice, Triac is taken up by the brain and suppresses serum TSH levels; consequently, serum T3 and T4 levels were lowered;
5. Triac is the treatment of choice in patient with the resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome. Patient with RTH have high serum TSH and thyroid hormone levels, which shows strong similarities to the profile found in AHDS patients; the longstanding experience with Triac in RTH indicates its safety and tolerability .

Thus, Triac treatment could result in normalization of the abnormal serum TH values in AHDS patients. Furthermore, Triac could replace the function of T3 in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake (e.g. brain).

The current trial will investigate if Triac treatment in ADHS patients

2. restores the local TH deficiency in brain.",46,MALE,1 Day,99 Years

NCT04422665,"['Muscle Loss', 'Disuse Atrophy', 'Protein Metabolism', 'Prehabilitation', 'Sarcopenia']",2019-10-01,"Episodes of inactivity due to hospitalisation, as short as 5 days, are associated with rapid muscle and strength loss in the elderly. The observed muscle loss with inactivity is likely due to muscle anabolic resistance and increased breakdown rates of muscle tissue. This is of great concern as the average hospital stay in the elderly is 5-6 days. Moreover, minor illnesses not requiring hospitalisation generally require short-term periods of inactive home-based recovery. The accumulation of repeated disuse events in older individuals manifests in a chronic muscle anabolic resistance (i.e. the inability of muscle to respond to anabolic stimuli such as exercise and nutrition) that may underpin the slow but devastating process of age-related muscle loss.

It is our belief that strategies to promote muscle health in ageing and reduce healthcare expenditure, should focus on alleviating muscle deterioration and anabolic resistance during short-term disuse.

In this regard, we propose that resistance exercise (i.e. weight lifting) performed prior to a disuse event (termed 'prehabilitation') may be sufficient to offset muscle loss in older individuals. Thus, we suggest the potent effect of resistance exercise in older muscles may prevent muscle loss during short-term disuse.",20,MALE,65 Years,80 Years

* ovarian stimulation with medications that are effective in women with diminished ovarian reserve but adversely affect the endometrium
* oocyte retrieval and vitrification
* fertilization and embryo transfer in a subsequent cycle with controlled endometrial preparation B) To determine the optimal stimulation protocol for women with diminished ovarian reserve incorporating oocyte vitrification

Currently available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the nitrogen balance method have been well described. Importantly, nitrogen balanced underestimates requirements.

The current dietary reference intakes (DRI) requirement for healthy adult males is based on the reanalysis of the nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was reanalyzed statistically by Rand et al. and he concluded that the protein requirement of healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83 (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO), our group estimated the protein requirement of young men (mean age 27 years) to be 0.93 and 1.2 g/kg/day (mean and RDA).

Currently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition survey conducted by national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES), the authors concluded that adults between the ages of 51 - 70 years old consumed an average on 1.0 g/kg/day (ideal body weight) of protein which represents about 15 % of calories. Depending on the calculations used for ideal body weight some older adults could be getting higher or lower than requirement. There is no scientifically derived protein estimate for older adults. Therefore there is a need to measurer protein requirement in that population.

Although it is known that a high-fat Western-style of diet has deleterious effects on (post-prandial) lipidemia and glucose homeostases, effects of such a diet on the small intestine is not known. To elucidate the role of the small intestine on the early development of the metabolic syndrome, the effects of a high-fat (HF) and a low-fat (LF) diet will be examined on gene expression in the small intestine and early biomarkers in blood of healthy subjects.

Objective: The objective of this study is to compare in healthy subjects the effects of a HF diet (40 En% fat) with those of a LF diet (20 En% fat) on early biomarkers and parameters of metabolic stress in blood and on expression of genes in the small intestine.

Additional research objectives are:

* To compare the diet-induced changes in transcriptome profile of the small intestine with more easily accessible peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
* To establish effects of HF and LF diet on basal gut permeability and after a chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) load (second hit).

Study design: Randomised crossover design. The duration of the experimental periods (HF and LF diet) will be 28 days, separated by a wash out period of at least 3 weeks.

The main reason for selecting spinal anaesthesia as the first choice for laparoscopic cases was its advantages over general anaesthesia which include uniform total muscle relaxation, a conscious patient, economical, relatively uneventful recovery, pain free early postoperative period and the protection from potential complications of general anaesthesia. The main debatable point, however, seems to be the status of respiratory parameters among the two modes of anaesthesia during laparoscopic surgery. In this context it can be stated that spontaneous physiological respiration during spinal anaesthesia would always be better than an assisted respiration as in general anaesthesia.

The pneumo-peritoneum induced rise in intra-abdominal pressure including pressure on the diaphragm and carbon dioxide induced peritoneal irritation are the factors to be considered",60,FEMALE,20 Years,40 Years

NCT00434265,['Obesity'],N/A,"Obesity is the consequence of a chronic disequilibrium of fat balance. Genetic factors determine predisposition to obesity, but the most often mentioned idea is that environmental factors, such as a high-fat diet and a sedentary lifestyle, join to favour weight gain and explain the increased prevalence of obesity in our westernized societies. Since lipogenesis is negligible in humans, obesity represents the consequence of altered fat partitioning between oxidation and storage, likely due to a preferential directing of dietary fat towards adipose tissue and away from muscle. Interventions that favour partitioning of dietary fat towards muscle for oxidation might thus protect against weight gain. Exercise may be one kind of such intervention but the scant data on dietary fat metabolism does not allow clear conclusions, in particular in obese subjects. One question concerns the impact of the type of fat eaten: the effects of physical inactivity may vary according to the length and saturation degree of the fatty acids. We hypothesize that 1) physical activity of moderate intensity, independently of its effect on energy balance, will favor a preferential trafficking towards adipose tissue, will modify the expression of genes implicated in fat oxidation and storage and partly correct the abnormalities observed in obese subjects, 2) effects of physical activity vary according to the saturation degree of fat. Twelve obese subjects, aged 18 to 55, will undergo tests before and after 2 months of training at current recommendations to ascertain dietary fat partitioning using stable isotopes and to determine changes in gene expression with muscle and adipose tissue microbiopsies.",12,MALE,18 Years,55 Years

This and other research concluded that in general, the motility readout of the isovolumetric balloon is associated with gastric contractions.

However, the exact relation between individual gastric contractions and individual intraballoon pressure waves remains incompletely understood.

Simultaneous assessment of gastric motility by means of an isovolumetric balloon and dynamic cine-MRI can validate that slow, high-amplitude intraballoon pressure waves are indeed induced by gastric muscle contractions. This evaluation might also enable us to attribute artefacts present in the pressure signal to physiologic processes such as cardiac, respiratory, intestinal and whole-body movements.

The inflammatory and procoagulant host response to infection are intricately linked and interactions between platelets, leukocytes and the endothelium play a central role in the pathogenesis of septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Interestingly, one key player cell in coagulation, i.e. the platelet, has been somewhat neglected as to its position in the pathogenesis of coagulation abnormalities in sepsis. However, thienopyridines, irreversible platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonists, e.g. prasugrel, could potentially provide beneficial anticoagulatory and antiinflammatory effects: P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonists reduce TF-induced coagulation activation in various ex vivo and in vitro models. Moreover, various lines of evidence indicate that thienopyridines may block platelet leukocyte interactions and thereby reduce the propagation of the coagulation and inflammation process.

LPS-infusion in healthy volunteers provides a standardized model to safely study non overt DIC and to document possible effects of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.

NCT01592526,['Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome'],2013-01,"Critical illness, severe infection, extensive trauma or tissue damage cause an inflammatory (irritative) reaction in the body. This reaction affects the whole body and causes malaise, circulatory and cardiac changes, fever, increases the number of white blood cells in the blood stream and prompts release of signaling proteins. This reaction contributes to the development of considerable organ damage and possibly organ failure. These are serious complications in critical illness which are associated with a high mortality. This inflammatory reaction is affected by the autonomic nervous system. This is the part of the nervous system, which is beyond the control of the free will, and the part that regulates circulation, breathing and digestive functions. The autonomic nervous system works via so-called sympathetic signals, which set the body in a state of alertness to overcome immediate challenges, and parasympathetic (vagal) signals, which are especially active during restitution and rest. It is known, that the balanced activity in the autonomic nervous system affects the body's inflammatory response in critical illness. A study in mice has shown that if parasympathetic (vagal) signals are blocked mortality in critical illness is increased. Reversely, when the autonomic nervous system is medically stimulated towards parasympathetic signaling, the magnitude of the inflammatory response is decreased. Nicotine exerts this stimulatory effect.

Also, we know that individuals in good physical shape have increased parasympathetic tone compared to less trained individuals. However, studies have never addressed whether this shifted balance in the autonomic nervous system affects the inflammatory response related to critical illness.

Over the last 30 years an experimental model mimicking the inflammatory response has been used in studies. Inflammation may be simulated by injecting the drug E.Coli LPS, which induces a controlled, fully reversible, harmless reaction the duration of which is a few hours. Influenza-like symptoms occur and changes in circulatory parameters and concentrations of signaling proteins can be measured.

Using this experimental model, the investigators wish to study whether this shifted balance in the autonomic nervous system in individuals in good physical shape affects the body's reaction to critical illness. Investigators also want to determine how nicotine (using a nicotine patch) affects this reaction.",23,MALE,18 Years,35 Years

NCT01740674,['Internet Data Collection'],2014-11,"One of the biggest challenges of conducting research where the investigators follow people over a long period of time is keeping the participants involved. One of way that investigators may be able to improve participant involvement in research is to give participants the opportunity to complete their questionnaires online.

Here's how the investigators think the Internet data collection system will help to keep participants involved and ultimately help to answer important questions about the effects of nutrition during pregnancy:

1. It will allow investigators to present complicated questionnaires in a way that doesn't confuse participants. For example, instead of telling participants to skip the remainder of a question if they answered no to the first part of the question, the ePRO system does the skipping for them. The result is less confusion, fewer questions to read, and less of the participant's time.
2. It provides a convenient way for participants to keep track of where to find the questionnaire, and how much they have already completed. Participants sometimes don't have time to answer all of the investigator's questions in one sitting. The ePRO system keeps track of how much participants have already done and it's ready to keep going whenever the participant has time. It also avoids the common problem of losing the questionnaires to the household paperwork pile, or worse to the recycling bin.
3. It provides timely reminders to participants. Study participants, and especially new moms, are busy and they forget to complete the questionnaires. The ePRO system can provide timely reminders encouraging participants to respond.
4. It helps participants complete the questionnaires accurately. The ePRO system has an automatic error detection ability that will alert participants to any questions they missed or completed incorrectly.

Finding ways to keep participants involved in research is something that all researchers are concerned about, and ultimately it's a concern for all Canadians because the results of research are often used to make decisions about health care and the kinds of programs that governments provide. Losing any participant from the study reduces the ability of policy makers to take the best decisions and choices about what health services to fund with limited dollars. What the investigators propose is a study to determine whether Internet data entry really will keep participants involved in a longitudinal study. Previous studies have shown that the internet can be a useful tool for getting people to sign up for research and at least one small study showed that using Internet data entry can actually save money. But no researchers have actually tested whether it really does a better job than paper based questionnaires in terms of keeping participants involved.

In order to answer this question, the investigators will randomly assign the current Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition study participants to either continue receiving the paper-based questionnaire or to start receiving the web-based surveys. The investigators will follow participants over three assessment occasions (over a period of 18 months) and observe any differences between the groups in their involvement. Because the investigators are randomly assigning participants to the two groups, differences in involvement will tell them about usefulness of Internet data entry as a participant retention tool.",301,FEMALE,16 Years,N/A

We are planning a large placebo controlled trial in pregnant women, to investigate whether optimisation of dietary vitamin E intake to the recommended 15mg/day reduces the likelihood of childhood asthma. We believe that a dietary intervention using vitamin E in its natural form of food is more likely to be successful and acceptable than a vitamin E supplement. We have previously demonstrated than pregnant women can optimise their vitamin E intake using a personalised dietary plan with the help of a dietitian however this intervention was complex and could not be translated into everyday use.

The leading malaria vaccine candidate in development is RTS,S which has efficacy against clinical malaria measured at 30-50% in the field. This partial protection might be enhanced by combination with other components. The other vaccination approach that has produced repeatable efficacy in humans is the use of viral vectors to induce T cell responses. Previous attempts with this vaccine approach have been effective in challenge studies in Oxford, but ineffective in the field, probably because of reduced immunogenicity.

NCT00197522,['Breast Neoplasms'],2012-05,"We, the researchers at Hamilton Health Sciences, have developed a novel approach to cancer therapy using transfected dendritic cells (DCs) to generate enhanced immunity to defined tumor antigens. Dendritic cells are highly specialized antigen presenting cells found in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, skin and thymus. Infection of DCs with Adenovirus (Ad) vectors incorporating genes for defined tumor antigens enables intracellular expression and major histocompatability complex (MHC)-restricted presentation of tumor peptides by transfected DCs. Given the potent immunostimulatory properties of DCs and ability to use gene transfer to ""load"" DCs with tumor antigen, we hypothesize that administration of transduced autologous DCs may have potential therapeutic benefit as a cancer vaccine. We have examined Ad-tumor antigen DC based vaccination in murine models of breast cancer and melanoma. In both models, injection(s) of Ad-transduced DCs results in highly potent immune activation and antigen-specific anti-tumor responses. In these models, high levels of antigen-specific, cytotoxic effector lymphocytes that recognize and kill cancer cells directly correlates with a therapeutic response (tumor regression and/or complete protection of animals subsequently re-challenged with tumor cells). Animals demonstrating specific in vitro immunity are protected against subsequent injection of cancer cells. Moreover, we have observed complete resolution and significant long-term survival in animals with established metastatic disease with no demonstrable toxicity. As opposed to vaccination protocols with tumor peptides or purified epitopes that are MHC-I restricted (i.e. HLA-A2), we have found that injection of DCs transduced with a vector expressing the entire tumor antigen results in peptide presentation from both MHC-I and MHC-II complexes. The subsequent immune response is comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Thus, Ad-based gene transfer of tumor antigens appears to be an efficient approach: (1) enabling sustained endogenous peptide processing, and (2) facilitating DC-specific presentation to the host immune system. We have shown that using a replication deficient adenovirus vector expressing Her-2/neu DNA under the control of a human mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter that we can transfect bone marrow derived DCs (AdHer2/DC). These cells are then used to immunize recipient mice against tumour challenge with Her2 transgenic tumour cells. The protection is antigen specific (anti Her2). On the basis of these pre-clinical studies we will initiate a pilot trial of the AdHer2/DC vaccine in Her -2/neu overexpressing patients with metastatic breast cancer. Long-term goals and implications of possible results: The goals of this initial pilot phase I study are to evaluate the safety and dosing schedule of the vaccine therapy. The vaccine will be tested in subsequent phase II and III studies to determine efficacy in comparison to standard therapies. The long-term goals are to eventually test this therapy in the adjuvant breast cancer setting in Her-2/neu overexpressing patients.",5,FEMALE,16 Years,80 Years

NCT04859322,"['Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease', 'Glucagon Resistance']",2021-12-09,"Many patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit elevated plasma concentrations of the glucose-mobilising pancreatic hormone glucagon; i.e. hyperglucagonaemia. This contributes to the hyperglycaemic state of the patients and is considered an important component in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes; but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. The liver constitutes the main target organ of glucagon, and studies have shown that hyperglucagonaemia goes hand in hand with hyperaminoacidaemia and that both are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), independently of the presence of type 2 diabetes. In line with this, several recent studies support the existence of a feedback-cycle between the liver and the pancreatic alpha cells, governed by circulating glucagon and amino acids. The investigators hypothesise that the presence of hepatic steatosis results in hepatic glucagon resistance at the level of amino acid turnover, i.e. impaired glucagon-induced suppression of circulating amino acid concentrations. If this hypothesis proves correct, it would establish build-up of fat in the liver as a core mechanism underlying hyperglucagonaemia and, since the hyperglucagonemia is at least partly responsible for the fasting hyperglycaemia, as an important contributor to the hyperglycaemia of type 2 diabetes.",20,MALE,20 Years,65 Years

* Do biomarkers of satiety alter differentially on meat or soya HPWL diet, as measured by monitoring alteration in plasma amino acids and gut-related hormones ?
* How does a vegetarian and meat-based weight loss diet impact on nitrosamine excretion in faecal samples, as an indicator of faecal toxicity?

Previous work has indicated that high-protein (30% protein) weight loss diets are more satiating (produce less hunger) than normal protein WL diet (15% protein) or a diet supplemented with few amino acids. In previous work, a mixed source of protein has been used, mainly from meat (beef, chicken, fish).

NCT02234648,['Hypertension'],2014-10,"Given the global health issues associated with poor cardiovascular function, interventions that help reduce the severity, with emphasis on prevention would not only have economic implications, but would also improve health, wellbeing and quality of life. Research provides evidence that consumption of a diet high in plant foods and rich is polyphenols is associated with a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (Hung et al 2004). Tart Montmorency cherries have been shown to be high in numerous phytochemicals (Wang et al 1999; Seeram et al 2001). Several of these compounds, are known to be vasoactive and improve blood vessel function by increasing bioavailability of vasodilators (Mudnic et al 2012), reducing vasoconstrictors (Broncel et al 2010), decreasing platelet aggregation (Hubbart et al 2006) and increasing blood vessel dilation (Schroeter et al 2006). Impaired function of the lining of blood vessels (endothelial dysfunction) has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the bioavailability of all the compounds in Tart Montmorency Cherry Juice and their efficacy with respect to vascular function has not been fully determined.

NCT02832648,['Osteoporosis'],2020-01-31,"This research aims to determine whether selenium supplements improve bone and muscle health in older women at risk of osteoporosis (low bone density or weak bones) and fracture (broken bones).

Osteoporosis is a major public health problem. One in two women and one in five men over age 50 will have a fracture. Fractures cause pain, disability and reduce life-expectancy. Women with below-average bone density around the time of the menopause might have previously taken hormone replacement (HRT) to prevent osteoporosis, but HRT is much less used now due to side effects. Therefore there is a need for safe, effective and inexpensive preventative interventions for women at risk of osteoporosis.

Selenium is a chemical nutrient present in several human proteins, including anti-oxidants. Anti-oxidants may protect against ageing of tissues, including bone, by mopping up damaging reactive oxygen molecules (sometimes called 'free radicals'). Selenium is present in soil, and so is obtained from many foods. However, soil selenium levels are low in Europe, and dietary intake in the UK is below recommended levels.

We previously found that women with higher blood selenium levels have stronger bones, but this doesn't prove that giving selenium will improve bone strength.

The investigators propose a randomised controlled trial to compare selenium supplements with a placebo (dummy treatment) in women with below-average bone density. The investigators will give selenium (at two different doses) or placebo to 120 women for six months and use blood and urine tests and bone density scans to see if giving selenium does have any effect on bone. The investigators will also do muscle function tests and measurements of free radical molecules.",123,FEMALE,55 Years,N/A

NCT01699425,['Female Stress Urinary Incontinence'],2016-04,"The transobturator tension-free vaginal tape (TOT) procedure has demonstrated high cure rates comparable to those obtained by retropubic suburethral tape, becoming the first line treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in many cases. The TOT procedure is not exempt from complications such as bleeding, bladder injuries and pain in the thigh/groin. In addition it is commonly performed under general or regional anesthesia1-3. The single-incision mini-slings (SIMS) were developed to reduce the risk of complications by avoiding the blind passage of the trocars through the obturator space. In addition, the use of SIMS could enable surgeons to perform the procedure truly under local anesthesia.

Different devices for SIMS procedure are available. However, the evidence about their efficacy is controversial4-7. The main limitation of these devices could be the predetermined length of the mesh and the weakness on its fixation. The design of the SIMS Ajust® allows adjusting the length of the sling to each individual woman and provides a robust fixation into the obturator membrane. Recent prospective studies on the efficacy and safety of the sling Ajust® have obtained promising results8,9. Even so, the NICE guidelines advise to use SIMS in the context of research studies10.

The objective of this study is to establish if the effectiveness of the SIMS Ajust® is non-inferior to that of a standard TOT, as well as to compare the comorbidity of both procedures. Owing to the new appearance and fast evolution of these procedures, randomized comparative studies with SIMS are required in order to determine its place in the treatment of SUI.",60,FEMALE,18 Years,90 Years

NCT03838822,['Healthy'],2018-11-01,"There is a strong correlation between major adverse health consequences of obesity and development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is characterized by abnormal hepatic accumulation of triglycerides and other lipids. It has become a worldwide health problem that accelerates cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and especially premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

The plasma level of glutathione (GSH) is typically depleted in individuals with metabolism related disorders. However, cellular GSH levels cannot be increased by supplementing GSH and it must be synthesized within the liver either de novo or by salvation pathway. The level of GSH is not enough to maintain and regulate the thiol redox status of the liver in subjects with high hepatic steatosis at fasting stage due to the depletion of glycine. Glycine can be synthesized via the interconversion of serine. It has been shown that the serine synthesis is downregulated in patients with NAFLD and supplementation of serine has attenuated alcoholic fatty liver by enhancing homocysteine metabolism in mice and rats. Depleted liver glutathione is also restored by the administration of N-acetylcystein as in acetaminophen poising. L-carnitine and nicotinamide that both stimulate the transfer of fatty acids from cytosol to mitochondria have been identified as two additional cofactors that are depleted in patients with NAFLD.

The effectiveness of the different nutritional regimes, which differ in their carbohydrate content, will be investigated not only by functional tests but also the measurement of the mechanistic processes in the muscle will be explored.

Magnetic resonance (MR), better known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been widely used in clinical practice as a non-invasive imaging technique. Importantly, in addition to producing anatomical images, an MR scanner also offers the possibility to measure the concentrations of a number of metabolic products. This is done through a technique known as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

This research project asks the following questions:

* Can a diet containing carbohydrates with a low glycemic index achieve the same adaptations in basic endurance/fat metabolism as a high fat, low carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet?
* Does a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, compared with a high-carbohydrate diet, prevent improvements in performance in the submaximal and maximal range?
* What is the effect of diets with different carbohydrate content and variable glycemic index on endurance performance in a half marathon and a time trial?
* How do the diets with different carbohydrate content and variable glycaemic index affect the energy and glycogen stores in the muscles?

In active recreational athletes, the objectives are: (1) to investigate the effects of different diets with variable carbohydrate content and glycaemic index on substrate metabolism, (2) to determine the effects of the different diets on energy stores using multinuclear dynamic magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and (3) to measure the effects of the different diets on endurance performance.",65,MALE,18 Years,40 Years

Early detection of prostate cancer has been shown to decrease mortality, but has limitations with low specificity leading to unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis of low-risk cancers. The STHLM3 trial has paved the way for improved specificity in early detection of prostate cancer using the blood-based STHLM3 test for identifying men at increased risk of harbouring significant prostate cancer.

Targeted prostate biopsies based on MRI images have been shown to increase sensitivity of high-grade cancers compared to the currently used systematic biopsies, but existing evidence are contradictory and not free from methodological flaws.

The primary aim of STHLM3-MR/Fusion is to increase the specificity in early detection of prostate cancer without decreasing the sensitivity of aggressive prostate cancers by introducing targeted prostate biopsies and comparing to traditional prostate biopsies. The primary endpoints are the number of performed biopsies and the number of detected high-grade prostate cancers defined as Gleason 7 or higher. Secondary endpoints include the number of low risk prostate cancers diagnosed and the proportion of patients with up-or downgraded disease after assessment of prostatectomy specimen. Additional aims include to assess the health economic consequences of implementing MRI based prostate cancer diagnostics and to improve the quality and effectiveness of prostate cancer diagnosis in the routine health care in Stockholm.

To support this goal, we need to know more about the normal fallopian tube (tube that passes the egg from the ovary into the womb). The purpose of this study is to learn about how menstrual cycles and hormonal contraceptives affect tubal patency. Normally there is an opening between the tube and uterus to permit the flow of fluid and cells. If this opening is blocked, this can result in infertility. Tubal patency is when a woman's fallopian tubes are not blocked. Tubal patency is determined by an x-ray test called a hystero-(uterus)salpingo-(fallopian tube)graphy (HSG). HSG is a standard radiological imaging study that is used to determine if the fallopian tubes are open and free of disease. It is commonly done in women with an infertility diagnosis. The investigators usually do this test in the first 10 days of the menstrual cycle. Sometimes the tubes will appear to be blocked on the HSG when they are actually open. The timing of the HSG study during the menstrual cycle, or the use of hormonal contraception may make a difference in whether the tubes appear blocked on the HSG when they are actually patent.

The results of the HSG test provide a good model for how our nonsurgical permanent contraception method might work. The investigators think that if the tubes are not patent, that our treatment will not work as well. Therefore, in this study we want to learn if menstrual cycle timing or current hormonal contraception use will affect the patency of the tubes as assessed by the HSG.

Epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers may therefore contribute to the cardiovascular risk profile, as well as environmental factors have a significant impact on the epigenetic program of gene expression. Methyl groups are usually added or removed as needed and can be influenced by diet soon, dietary factors have been linked to the change of DNA methylation, resulting in changes in gene expression. Research on the prevalence of gene methylation levels on the impact of nutrient intake, as well as the inflammatory condition and the results of dietary interventions for the genes, it is a sparse area in studies and, therefore, expanding of the knowledge. Thus, understanding the effects of a diet rich in antioxidants and hazelnut oil, in inflammation and DNA methylation profile is important because chronic diseases with cardiovascular disease can begin with the consumption of modified lipids and can research this stage provide important dietary allowances for the development of this disease prevention strategies even in adulthood.

NCT02932930,['Pain'],2019-06,"The original concept of a quadratus lumborum block (QLB) indicated for analgesia after abdominal surgery was first described by Blanco in 2007. Also referred to as a posterior transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, the QLB consists in deposition of local anesthetic on either the posterior or the anterolateral border of the quadratus lumborum muscle. TAP blocks have already been proved effective in urologic, abdominal, and gynecologic procedures by blocking the sensory nerve supply to the anterior abdominal wall thus reducing the amount of postoperative analgesic medication. The main advantages of QLB compared to the TAP block is a wider sensory block area and a longer duration of analgesia. This is due to the extension of local anesthetic agents beyond the TAP plane to the thoracic paravertebral space(4).

Previous reports have shown that QLB is effective in providing pain relief after various abdominal operations. However, there are no published reports on QLB for postoperative pain after abdominoplasty. This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study aims to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, opioids consumption and quality of recovery of QLB in patients undergoing abdominoplasty.

To investigate this relationship, moderate alcohol consumption will be used as a mood modulator, because of its well-studied effects on mood. Postprandial mood depends on the current mood state. Therefore the investigators will manipulate the current mood state by changing the ambiance to measure the influence of moderate alcohol consumption with a meal on postprandial mood in a pleasant or unpleasant ambiance.

The intervention is a simple cognitive task (a memory cue followed by playing the computer game ""Tetris"") with accompanying information. A within-subjects multiple baseline AB design is used, in that the length of baseline ('A'; no intervention) and intervention ('B') phases vary within-subjects across individual intrusive trauma memories. Participants will aim to complete at least one week of the baseline ('A') phase followed by at least two intervention sessions with a researcher remotely (via telephone or secure video platform). Intervention sessions comprise the simple cognitive task alongside accompanying information presented in the form of brief animated videos (e.g., explaining the target symptom). Participants are instructed that they may continue using the technique self-guided in subsequent weeks, and they may opt for additional intervention sessions with remote researcher support (maximum 6 intervention sessions). Participants will be asked to monitor the occurrence of intrusive memories of trauma in a daily diary. It is predicted that participants will report fewer total intrusive memories in the fifth week after the second intervention session (primary outcome) compared to in the first baseline week. The investigators will also explore whether the frequency of targeted intrusive memories is going to decrease relative to non-targeted intrusive memories.

Estimates indicate that in low resource settings, CS comprises up to 50% of more of the total volume of operations performed. The World Health Organization recommends national CS rates of between 10-15% to save lives and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. Population-based work indicates that CS rates of up to 19% are demonstrably related to improved maternal and neonatal survival. However, complications are common, and gynecological and obstetric surgical interventions are associated with high rates of morbidity. In low resource settings, complication rates are particularly high.

The intervention being tested is based on a previously developed program called Clean Cut. Clean Cut is an adaptive, multimodal surgical infection prevention program that integrates perioperative process improvement and patient outcomes measurement using process mapping, training and improved management practices, and compliance with critical standards of surgical antisepsis. It was successfully piloted in five surgical departments in Ethiopia, and reduced the relative risk of infection by 35%.

Chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy to remove cancerous tissue can result in deficits in attention, speed of processing, memory, and quality of life. Physical activity has been associated with a number of health benefits for breast cancer survivors including improvements in cognitive function. The investigators recently reported on the beneficial effects of acute exercise, or single sessions of physical activity, on processing speed and spatial working memory in breast cancer survivors, suggesting that acute bouts of physical activity may mitigate select domains of CRCI. Specifically, survivors in this study demonstrated faster processing speed, and trended towards faster and more accurate spatial working memory, after thirty minutes of moderate-intensity walking compared to seated rest. But half an hour of walking may be challenging to certain subgroups of survivors, particularly those who are deconditioned or with significant barriers to longer walks. With a renewed focus on un-bouted physical activity and avoiding inactivity during survivorship, it is important to better understand the dose or volume of exercise responsible for providing breast cancer survivors with the greatest cognitive benefits.

Regular physical activity, including muscle strengthening exercises, is beneficial to a healthy elderly. Thus, this study aimed to verify the influence of 8 weeks-program of lower limbs strengthening exercises in the balance and functional mobility of physically active elderly. The investigators evaluated 18 women, with ages between 61 and 80 years. Balance assessment was performed using the Functional Reach Test (FRT), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and Romberg test in stable or unstable soil. For muscular strengthening of the lower limbs, the workload was determined by the strength reached in the eight-repetition maximum test (8RM), applying progressive load increments between training sessions conducted (50% , 60% , 70% of 8RM), with the muscle strength being reevaluated in the fourth week of training, with subsequent adjustment of the load for the subsequent training. The training took place in two weekly meetings, in 40-minute sessions, during eight weeks. Data were analyzed using the paired-t test and ANOVA with repeated measures. Among 18 evaluated elderly women, 7 completed the 8 week training proposed. Decrease in TUG time (p = 0,035) and statistically significant increase in muscle strength were observed in all muscle groups trained (quadriceps, hamstrings, adductors and abductors). FRT (p = 0.170) was not significantly different after training. Therefore, strength training proposed was efficient in improving muscle strength in the lower limbs of irregular physically active elderly, impacting positively on functional gain gait. However, the gain in muscle strength was not enough to generate significant results in static balance probably due to the type of exercise performed as well as due being limited to muscle groups of the lower limbs.",7,FEMALE,61 Years,80 Years

Chronic endometritis (CE) is an inflammation of the endometrium diagnosed by the presence of plasma cells in the endometrial stroma. There is not only no census on the definition of CE, the current literature on the impact of CE on reproductive outcome is controversial and consists only of retrospective studies with small sample sizes. Although there is a presumption that CE is related to poor IVF outcome, this belief has not been proven.

Design: Prospective cohort study

Setting: Infertility clinics of 2 academic medical centers

Patients: Patients between the ages of ≥ 21 and ≤ 35 years old undergoing their first IVF cycle will be invited to participate.

Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome will be ongoing pregnancy after 12 weeks estimated gestational age (EGA) with previously documented fetal cardiac motion. Secondary outcomes will include pregnancy loss rate as defined by chemical pregnancy, blighted ovum or loss of fetal cardiac motion before 12 weeks EGA.

Materials and Methods: The cycle prior to IVF, patients will undergo an in-office endometrial biopsy on cycle days 19-24. Samples will be stained for CD138 and the number of plasma cells will be quantified. The number of plasma cells in a sample that yields the best sensitivity and specificity for pregnancy will be determined by a Receiver-Operator-Curve.

NCT01514630,"['Depression', 'Substance Abuse', 'Substance Use', 'Neuroimaging', 'Dual Diagnosis']",2014-12,"Methamphetamine (MA) is a psychostimulant drug with high abuse potential. MA can be smoked, snorted, injected or ingested orally to produce a release of high levels of dopamine into the brain and reduction of dopamine uptake. Its use results in feelings of pleasure, increased energy, and greater alertness lasting up to 12 hours. In 2010, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that 353,000 Americans aged 12 or older reported being current MA users. Over the past decade MA use rates have fluctuated with current use rates on the decline; however, importantly, even though overall use rates are declining, use rates among males and females are approaching equal proportions. This use rate pattern is unlike other drugs of abuse, which typically demonstrate males using more than females. In some states, more females than males consider MA as their drug of choice. Namely, in a 2010 report in the state of Utah, more females were diagnosed with MA as a primary substance of abuse than males upon admission to treatment.

Depression and MA use are highly comorbid. The relationship between MA use and depression is likely bidirectional, with MA use causing changes in mood and being used as a self-medicating behavior to reduce symptoms of depression. Several studies have shown that depression rates are higher in MA-using females compared to their male counterparts. It is likely that neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms contribute to increased incidence of depressive symptoms in females.

No clear treatment model exists to suggest how the comorbidity of depression and MA use is best managed. In studies of antidepressants for treatment of MA withdrawal and dependence, findings have suggested that antidepressants are ineffective for treating depressive symptoms.

Creatine is an organic acid occurring naturally in vertebrates, where it takes part in energy homeostasis in tissues with fluctuating energy demands. Exogenous creatine has been shown to increase brain concentrations of PCr. Neuroimaging studies of creatine have shown increased brain phosphocreatine (PCr) content with creatine administration. Therefore, we hypothesize that oral creatine administration will increase PCr levels and reduce depressive symptoms in a sample of depressed female MA users. This hypothesis will be tested by a within subjects design by giving depressed MA using females oral creatine for eight weeks and measuring PCr pre- and post-treatment with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Moreover, depressive symptoms will be measured by administration of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale twice weekly during the course of creatine treatment.",14,FEMALE,13 Years,64 Years

The molecular links and metabolic shifts driving this association remain open to debate, but notably, reduced muscle mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) ß-oxidation is more prevalent among insulin-resistant/diabetic persons. Therefore, discovery of biomarkers reflective of the status of an individual's muscle FA ß-oxidation activity or capacity would have tremendous prognostic and diagnostic value in terms of diabetes. Furthermore, characterization of metabolites associated with muscle mitochondrial fat metabolism should uncover candidate signaling factors which tie FA ß-oxidation to insulin signaling. The investigators propose to identify, for the first time, specific biomarkers of muscle FA ß-oxidation using multiple metabolomic analytical platforms to compare metabolite profiles in samples derived from biological systems displaying disparate muscle fat combustion.

After informed consent has been obtained, patients will be enrolled in this randomized-controlled equivalence study. The experimental group will be prescribed 20 oxycodone-acetaminophen and the control group will be prescribed 28 oxycodone-acetaminophen at the time of discharge. Both groups will also be provided with a handout on non-opioid analgesia. The groups will be assigned randomly in blocks. The investigators will recruit patients either in the clinic, if participants are to have a scheduled cesarean section, or at some time during the hospital admission for delivery. The satisfaction survey and pain scale will be administered at the postoperative check by the clinic staff and providers. These surveys will be stored in a secure location at the clinic. If the patient does not show up for their postoperative visit, 3 attempts total will be made by an investigator to reach the patient and administer both surveys by phone within 2 weeks of discharge. A preliminary analysis of the data will be done once half the study patients have been recruited. The investigators do not foresee any threats to the external or internal validity of the study. The investigators are taking many measures to limit study bias. First, block randomization will help limit discrepancies between groups. Also, strict adherence to the inclusion and exclusion criteria will also help limit confounders that may make data difficult to interpret, such as non-opioid naïve patients and complications that may potentially increase pain and opioid requirements.

NCT04911725,['Obstructive Sleep Apnea-hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS)'],2021-05-24,"Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by the occurrence of abnormally frequent episodes of interrupted ventilation (apnea) or significant reduction of ventilation (hypopnea) during sleep. It is linked to a repeated collapse of the upper airways during sleep.

Episodes of apnea and hypopnea cause hypoxemia and micro-awakenings with a well-established impact on quality of life and daily activities. Physiologically, OSAHS can be aggravated when moving from a standing to a supine position through fluid shift from the lower limbs to the upper body, thereby modifying the opening of the upper airways. A decrease of the water balance by bilateral diurnal compression of the lower limbs (during daytime in standing position) may limit this nocturnal fluid shift (at night in supine position) and thus reduce the severity of OSAHS.

Two comparative clinical trials \[Redolfi 2011; White 2015\] have shown a clinically modest reduction of sleep apnea (-36% and -27%, respectively), which was however statistically significant versus untreated control group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.04, respectively), when elastic compression medical devices of 20 to 30 mmHg were worn during the daytime. The hypothesis of fluid shift influence on OSAHS has been tested \[Berg 1993; Redolfi 2011; White 2015\], but the decrease of the water balance when the device is used remains to be quantified.

The CVE101-15 exploratory clinical investigation sponsored by Laboratoires Innothera performed on healthy volunteers confirmed the hypothesis of a diuretic effect of elastic compression stockings applying a pressure of 33 mmHg at the ankle, worn for 13-14 hours during the daytime for 3 days, with a good safety profile of this device. Moreover, it enabled the identification of reliable parameters and the endpoints to be used to demonstrate a diuretic effect.

Based on this information, there may be a real interest in conducting further investigations about the evolution of water balance beyond a 3-day period of elastic compression use in the daytime.

Hence, the main objective of this clinical investigation is to compare precisely, under standardized test conditions, water balance changes in healthy subjects over 5 days with or without daytime use of the investigational medical device (IMD), an elastic compression device prototype specially designed for this study.",38,MALE,40 Years,N/A

It is estimated that LBW causes 60 to 80 % of neonatal deaths. For the survivors, the effects are long lasting and largely irreversible. Infants born LBW are at 2-4 times greater risk to develop acute diarrhea, pneumonia or acute respiratory tract infection than their normal birth weight counterparts. Adults born with LBW suffer increased risk of high blood pressure, coronary heart disease (CHD), non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, obstructive lung diseases, or renal damage.

In Bangladesh, there was a high incidence of UTI in 21-25 years age group (44.61%). The bottom line for GU infection is that lactobacilli, healthy bacteria lose their dominant. Recently, the protective role of the commensal microbiota has come into focus for its infection-inhibiting function. Lactobacilli that colonize the gastrointestinal tract or vagina can either significantly modulate the colonic microbiota by increasing the number of specific prebiotic bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria or reducing undesired intestinal colonization of pathogenic bacteria. Prebiotic like Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) is known to promote growth of normal healthy flora like lactobacilli (LAB).

Latina girls are less likely to meet guidelines for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) than non-Hispanic white girls; factors that contribute to low PA rates among Latina girls include sex role expectations, low PA competency, few active role models, lack of parental support for PA, and lack of access to resources.

The goal of this study, informed by social cognitive theory and family systems theory, is to design, implement, and evaluate an intervention promoting physical activity among Latina pre-adolescent girls (aged 8-11) and their mothers. The intervention is based on evidence suggesting that parent-child interventions and single-sex interventions are more effective at improving PA. Mothers and daughters will participate in a 12-week virtual intervention where they will engage in weekly 1.5-hour sessions that incorporate didactic teaching, skill-building, interactive discussions, and PA.

However, approximately one third of abortion facilities do not offer abortions at less than six weeks of pregnancy. Providers may be concerned that they will be unable to identify products of conception (POCs) in uterine aspirates after early abortion and about the time, cost and risk associated with following serum hCG levels when completed abortion cannot be confirmed by gross inspection. Many providers believe that manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) causes less destruction of pregnancy tissue and therefore may increase the likelihood of identifying POCs on gross inspection. No published reports specifically compare MVA to electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) for the detection of complete products of conception and none compare MVA and EVA at less than 6 weeks of pregnancy. We, the investigators, propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the sensitivity of MVA to EVA for the detection of completed abortion in 500 women with pregnancies of less than 6 weeks gestation at a large inner city family planning center.

NCT03231657,['Preeclampsia'],2022-06-21,"Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The morbidity and mortality of this condition arises from two main causes: 1) the lack of specific and sensible methods for its diagnosis and prognosis, 2) and the fact that the course of the disease is often unpredictability at its presentation and speed of progression. The majority of deaths are undoubtedly avoidable and are due to a substandard care. Nowadays it's known that preeclampsia is a placental disorder that is characterized by an unbalance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. It has been recently proven that the ratio of sFlt-1 to PlGF in women who presented with a clinical suspicion of preeclampsia is useful distinguishing between women in whom preeclampsia would develop and those in whom it would not. A low ratio also predicted the absence of fetal adverse outcomes in the same time frame. In addition this ratio demonstrated to be useful to discriminate among patients that would developed maternal or fetal adverse outcome. Correct identification and diagnosis of women at risk could potentially prevent all these adverse outcomes thus, clinical experience suggests that early detection and monitoring are beneficial.

EuroPE aims to provide evidence that the re-definition of pre-eclampsia as an entity caused by a placental unbalance of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors and its incorporation in the diagnosis and classification of the disease would improve maternal and neonatal health.

This will be an open, multicentre, international, randomised controlled trial with an intention-to -treat analysis. The study is pragmatic: it will be undertaken to reflect real clinical practice rather than the very tightly controlled circumstances of explanatory trials. The main objective of this study is to determine the effects of the use of the ratio as a diagnostic tool in the definition and classification of PE, as compared with its usual definition, in triage and delivery decisions and to see whether this new approach is able to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes.",2536,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

The Investigators have chosen to focus on MA women because MA women are at very high risk for progression to diabetes and have not traditionally been involved in weight management studies since they are thought to be difficult to recruit and retain in such programs. However, investigators have had particular success in working with young MA women using specifically developed ethnic and gender conscious programs. Because weight loss does not prevent all progression to diabetes, some participants will receive the diabetes medication, liraglutide, which has been shown to stabilize beta cell function. The study will also interrogate for polymorphisms of known T2DM genes to correlate with beta cell response to weight loss and liraglutide treatment. Additionally, this investigation targets serious health disparities in metabolic disease in a highly vulnerable, rapidly growing population, testing novel gender and culturally focused intervention strategies and identifying genetic biomarkers of response to a pharmacologic intervention that targets the pancreatic ßcell.

We hypothesize significantly improved outcomes in the intervention group compared to the control group at post-treatment and at all follow-ups. The pilot will use a quasi-randomized design, with participants assigned to alternating treatment and control blocks. Analyses will be conducted using intent to treat and per protocol methods. Following group assignment, all women will be scheduled for a baseline interview at a time convenient for the participant. Participant interviews will take approximately 1.5 hours. Mothers will be compensated with a gift card in the amount of 40 USD for each interview. In addition to the core evaluation metrics, mothers' demographic information will be obtained (age, relationship status, employment, education, number of children, income). Following the baseline interview, the PMEP will be provided to the treatment group; participants will receive 2-hours of contact time per week for 5 weeks (2-hour sessions, held once weekly). Women will receive reminder calls the day of each session to identify and resolve any barriers to attendance (e.g., transportation). Taxi fare will be supported for women who are unable to obtain transportation if the bus is not feasible. Following the completion of the PMEP groups or - for the control group - after 5-6 weeks has passed, all participants will complete a second interview. This interview will include all of the core measures of hypothesized treatment change, thereby permitting a comparison between women in the treatment and control groups over time. All women will be invited in a third time when their infant is 3 months old and again when their infant is 1 year of age to evaluate parenting and infant outcomes.

The mechanism by which berberine exerts a protective role in atherosclerosis is unclear. Protoberberines have been identified as a new inhibitor of AKR1C3, an enzyme responsible for the regulation of steroid hormone action.3 The investigators propose to examine the effects of berberine on a set of well-established CVD risk factors including lipids, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, coagulation factors, adiposity, fasting glucose, insulin, and liver function, as well as to examine potential mediation via testosterone and/or sex hormone binding globulin using a mechanistic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Chinese men with hyperlipidemia.",84,MALE,20 Years,65 Years

NCT01583322,['Ovarian Cancer'],2015-05,"Patients with extensive and bulky disease are often those whose initial surgery is delayed after 3 or 4 cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.

In that case, there is, indeed, some concern to administer bevacizumab during the chemotherapy surrounding the interval debulking surgery due to the long half life (14- 21 days) of this monoclonal antibody and the interference of anti angiogenic agents with wound healing.

Vargatef® (Nintedanib) might offer a better alternative to bevacizumab in the neo-adjuvant setting. Vargatef® (Nintedanib) has a much shorter half-life of 7 to 19 hours.

NCT04491422,"['HIV', 'PrEP', 'Transgender Women', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Bacterial']",2023-07-05,"Transgender women (trans women; assigned male sex at birth but identify as female) are at high risk for HIV infection, and are an important, under-researched population in sub-Saharan Africa. Trans women have a 13 times greater risk of acquiring HIV than adults aged 15-49 years in the general population, and in Africa, trans women have nearly twice the HIV prevalence (25%) of men who have sex with men \[MSM\] (14%). Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective prevention tool that could change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic among the 25 million trans women globally, yet its use has been suboptimal in this vulnerable population. Same-day PrEP initiation is feasible and acceptable and improves retention in PrEP care in resource-rich settings. Same-day initiation of emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF), a new PrEP regimen, has not to our knowledge previously been evaluated as PrEP in African trans women. F/TAF is potentially more efficacious and safer than emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (F/TDF) as shown in the recent DISCOVER trial. However, concerns about drug-drug interactions between feminizing hormonal therapy (FHT) and PrEP are a key potential adherence barrier for trans women. While PrEP drugs do not lower FHT levels, FHT decreases plasma TFV and (emtricitabine) FTC levels. Little is known about FHT use among African trans women taking F/TAF or how concerns about F/TAF-FHT interactions may influence PrEP adherence. Moreover, interventions to support PrEP adherence in this population are needed. Feedback about PrEP use has been shown to potentially improve PrEP adherence among MSM but has not been utilized among trans women. Key knowledge gaps include: 1) whether same-day PrEP can be successfully implemented for African trans women, 2) the impact of drug-level feedback on PrEP adherence, and 3) how use of FHT may influence PrEP adherence.

To address these questions, this protocol describes a randomized trial to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of same day initiation of F/TAF PrEP, evaluate impact of drug-level feedback on PrEP adherence and characterize PrEP persistence, and in-depth interviews to explore how self-care interventions for sexual health influence prevention choices among trans women and their sexual partners.

NCT03572439,['Labor Pain'],2019-01-10,"Assessment of the upper sensory block level during neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery is an essential component of clinical management and patient safety. A variety of methods have been used for testing the sensory block such as cold, light touch, sharp touch or prick and transcutaneous electrical stimulation. In addition to the diversity of methods, the endpoints used by investigators have also been variable, considering total or partial responses as endpoints. Not surprisingly, a variable sensory block level could be identified as a result of the different methods and types of question asked by the examiner. Another complicating factor is the lack of standardization of the direction of the testing as it relates to anesthetized and non-anesthetized areas. This lack of standardization may result in a difference of several dermatomes in the level that two different assessors might record for the same patient. Considering a clinical research scenario, it may be difficult to replicate results and implement clinical practices.

NCT00214422,['Prostate Cancer'],2014-05-27,"BACKGROUND:

-This study represents a progression from findings in four previous National Cancer Institute (NCI) Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) protocols (02-C-0167A, 02-C-0207E, 03-C-0190B, 04-C-0171). In these previous works we have begun to develop techniques to obtain Magnetic Resonance (MR) biological images and co-register tissue in prostate cancer patients.

OBJECTIVES:

-The primary objective of the first portion of this study is to assess the feasibility of using Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to treat the at-risk lymph nodes in prostate cancer. Also, if feasible, we hope optimize this technique with experience.

ELIGIBILITY:

-This is a study of image guided, targeted radiation therapy in patients with high risk of nodal metastases from prostate cancer. Patients with prostate cancer who have more than 15% risk of lymph node (as defined by the Partin tables) metastasis will be eligible for this study.

DESIGN:

* On the first 10 patients, we will perform approximately 5 computed tomography (CT) simulations throughout the course of their therapy. On each simulation, the initial treatment plan will be re-run. The dose-volume data from target and normal tissues will then be re-analyzed. From this analysis we will be better able to determine the size of margins needed to account for organ motion and changes such as varying amounts of gas in the bowel and fluid in the bladder. To the best of our knowledge, no such analyses have been published.
* If the initial part of this trial is feasible, we will proceed to a phase I dose escalation trial of radiation to the at-risk lymph nodes. The primary statistical objective of the phase I portion of this study is to estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of external beam radiation based on evaluating acute toxicity. The study will be conducted with a dose-escalation design with 3 patients in each dose cohort. If fewer than 2 of 3 patients experience an acute dose limiting toxicity (DLT) than patients will be accrued to the next dose cohort. If 2 or more of 3 patients experience a DLT then the MTD will be exceeded and the prior, lower dose cohort will be considered the MTD. Secondary objectives of this study are to relate patterns in gene and protein expression to response and toxicity and to evaluate the frequency of late term toxicity.
* Specific procedures and risks will be described in a separate consent to be obtained at the time of biopsy. Tissue samples will be processed for complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray testing and stored for future analysis in the Radiation Oncology Branch, NCI.
* Anatomic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance (MR) biological images of the prostate and pelvis will be obtained and tissue will be acquired with biopsy locations precisely translated (co-registered) to an MR image of reference. A fiducial marker (gold seed) will be left at the biopsy site as a fiducial marker to direct future radiation therapy to the prostate. If necessary, additional fiducial markers will be placed for prostate localization during treatment.",19,MALE,18 Years,90 Years

NCT01644539,['Appetite Regulation'],2011-12,"The amount and kind of food which is ingested influences the regulation of meal size. Neural signals from the gastrointestinal tract travel via the vagus nerve to the brainstem and thalamus, which projects to the rest of the brain, in particular the hypothalamus, amygdala and primary sensory cortices. In neuroimaging studies in which the stomach was distended with a gastric balloon activation was observed in the right insula, left posterior amygdala, left posterior insula, left inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex. So far, no study has examined the effects of the ingestion or infusion of a food on the brain. In addition to neural signals, hormonal signals are important for meal termination. Hormones like insulin, ghrelin and cholecystokinin interact with gastric as well as sensory signals in the process of satiation, which ultimately leads to meal termination. The aim of this study is to investigate the interaction between food administration, hormone responses and brain responses.

NCT01108939,"['Malaria, Falciparum']",2009-09,"Anemia is still a main public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Anemic women have an increased maternal and perinatal mortality and anemic adults have diminished work capacity. In sub-Saharan Africa, the etiology of anemia is multifactoral; the major causes are low dietary bioavailability and chronic parasitic infections such as malaria. These causes are likely to interact because infection and infection-associated inflammation may impair the utilization and absorption of iron. Therefore, the control of parasite infections may be important to improve iron bioavailability from foods.

Malaria infections are endemic in northern Benin. To investigate the contribution of asymptomatic malaria (a positive blood smear for malarial parasites but without clinical symptoms of fever, headache or malaise) to anemia, we are planning a human iron absorption study in Benin. We will recruit adults with asymptomatic malaria infection. The iron absorption and utilization of the study subjects will be studied while infected, then they will be treated to clear their infections, and then iron absorption and utilization will be restudied. Iron absorption will be determined by incorporation of labeled iron into erythrocytes, 14 days after the administration of a test meal containing labeled iron (stable isotope technique).

NCT02571439,['POSTOPERATIVE PAIN'],2015-08,"The TAP is a space between the muscle layers of the abdominal wall that houses nerves supplying the abdominal skin. Injecting the local anesthetic ropivacaine into this space will block these nerves and prevent pain following c-section. The investigators will compare two different approaches to injecting the local anesthetic in this space. Conventionally, the block is done after surgery is completed and the abdomen is closed. The anesthesiologist introduces a needle through the abdominal wall skin under ultrasound guidance to reach the TAP space and the drug is injected. Since the TAP layer is one of the deeper layers of the abdominal (belly) wall and is closer to the inside of the abdomen than to the outside (skin), injecting from the inner aspect of the abdominal wall during the surgery is easier and quicker to perform than the conventional block and does not require ultrasound guidance as there is no risk of injury to abdominal organs like the liver.

With this research the investigators attempt to prove that surgically administered TAP blocks take 25% less time to perform compared to the conventionally administered TAP block for post cesarean section pain relief.

NCT01537822,"['Large Intrauterine Polyps', 'Smaller Type 0 and 1 Myomas', 'Residual Placental Tissue']",2018-07-01,"Rationale:

The hysteroscopic morcellator (HM) is a novel technique for removal of intrauterine polyps, myomas and placental tissue. It withholds some technical advantages over resectoscopy. Previous data suggest that it's a faster technique than the latter, and shows that it has a low complication rate.

Objective:

To compare the HM to bipolar resectoscopy for removal of:

1) large intrauterine polyps, 2) smaller type 0 and 1 myomas, 3) residual placental tissue, in terms of efficiency and complications.

Study design: Single blind, randomized controlled multicenter trial.

Study population: Women aged over 18 years old with:

1) large (≥ 1 cm) intrauterine polyps, 2) smaller (≤ 3 cm) type 0 or 1 myomas, 3) residual placental tissue, who are planned for hysteroscopic removal.

Intervention:

Patients are randomized between removal with the HM or the bipolar resectoscope.

Main study parameters/endpoints:

Installation and operating time.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:

Women who are referred to our polyclinic will be seen on a first visit, and, according to the standard work-up, an ultrasound will be performed when intrauterine pathology is suspected. To confirm the diagnosis a saline infusion sonography (SIS) and/or ambulant diagnostic hysteroscopy will be performed consequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed and surgery is planned, women will be asked whether they want to take part in this study. At this moment, both techniques are used in our hospitals and the choice of treatment depends on the preference of the gynaecologist. All women will be treated with operative hysteroscopy in a daycare setting according to the standard of care, only now randomized between the two techniques. A standard postoperative visit with ultrasound examination and/or ambulant diagnostic hysteroscopy is scheduled 6 weeks later. Late postoperative complications and complaints are recorded.

It is expected that the HM beholds some advantages over the bipolar resectoscope such as shorter operating time and less complications (e.g. risk of perforation, current and fluid related complications). Previous data do not demonstrate any additional risks related to the use of the HM. Moreover we will check whether the HM has a lower risk of intrauterine adhesion formation, as this might influence patient's fertility.

NCT04435925,"['Breast Disease', 'Anesthesia', 'Inflammatory Response']",2020-12-30,"Mastectomy triggers stress and inflammation responses due to tissue trauma. Surgical stress will increase levels of hormones (adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, antidiuretic hormone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) and inflammatory cytokines (Tumor Necrotic Factor-α, interleukin-1, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6) in the body. This causes insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis, and impaired insulin secretion, which results in hyperglycemia due to intraoperative stress. Intraoperative hyperglycemia increases postoperative complications and mortality. Inhibition of hyperglycemia due to operative stress and stress hormones with good anesthetic management in improving patient outcomes.

The choice of opioid type plays an important role in suppressing the perioperative stress and inflammatory response. Opioids are an alternative, besides the use of regional anesthetic techniques which have been proven to suppress the perioperative stress response. Fentanyl is one of the phenylpiperidine synthetic opioids. Large doses of fentanyl can reduce stress responses but also increase side effects, such as hemodynamic instability and decrease T-cell function.

Remifentanil provides unique pharmacokinetic benefits through nonspecific esterase enzyme metabolism, so it has a very fast onset and half-life. In addition, remifentanil also provides benefits in reducing the production of interleukin 6 cytokines (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and inhibits neutrophil migration through the endothelial layer.

The stress response to stress and inflammation is directly proportional to the dose of remifentanil given. It is reported that remifentanil can suppress cortisol response according to increasing dose.

Winterhalter et al. and Lee et al. reported that remifentanil is better at suppressing the stress response than fentanyl. On the other hand, Bell et al. showed no difference in cortisol and hemodynamic levels between the two groups.

The goal of this study is to see if remifentanil provides less increase in serum epinephrine level, norepinephrine level, platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), and blood glucose level at one-hour and 24-hours postoperative in patients undergoing mastectomy surgery under general anesthesia.",48,FEMALE,30 Years,65 Years

NCT00783822,['Breast Neoplasms'],2011-01,"5-10% of breast cancer patients carry a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Genetic counseling and DNA testing are usually offered to selected patients after primary treatment has been completed (e.g. the first year after diagnosis). For women with a mutation in one of the two breast-ovarian cancer syndrome genes, chances of a second breast cancer are high, and therefore a proportion of these women may opt for preventive measures in addition to their immediate breast cancer treatment. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy significantly reduces this risk, and is associated with a reduction in mortality.

Genetic counseling and testing for breast cancer typically takes approximately 4-6 months to complete. However, some hospitals and laboratories are now able to generate test results within 3 to 6 weeks.

NCT01367639,['Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome'],2011-12,"Breast cancer (BC) is a major health problem and the most prevalent cancer among women.In a substantial proportion of familial cases, germ-line mutations in either BRCA1/2 can be detected. The only proven modality for active risk reduction (rather than passive early detection), is prophylactic surgery - prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy. While the majority of Jewish mutation carriers elect to undergo prophylactic oophorectomy at about age 40 years, in Israel only a minority perform prophylactic mastectomy. Another ramification of being a mutation carrier is the emotional stress associated with that discovery.Genetic information has profound implications for mutation carriers. The IBSR (Inquiry-based stress reduction) intervention, developed by Byron Katie, trains participants to reduce their perceived level of stress by self-inquiry of their thoughts and beliefs connected to stressful circumstances or symptoms. This meditative process, named ""The Work"", enables the participants to identify and question the stressful thoughts that cause their suffering. The core of IBSR is simply four questions and a turnaround, which is a way of experiencing the opposite of what the participant believes. This process is simple, powerful and provides skills for self-inquiry and management of stressful thoughts that can be easily implemented in daily life \[ \]. Therefore, on the basis of previous data and beneficial observations we postulate that the clinical utility of IBSR mediation program may improve psychological and physical symptoms and quality of life among asymptomatic (oncologically healthy) BRCA1/ BRCA2 mutation carriers. Thus, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to scientifically investigate the effect of this intervention effects on BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.",67,FEMALE,35 Years,70 Years

NCT01952639,['Sarcopenia'],2014-10,"Rationale: The progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass with aging, or sarcopenia, has a major impact on our health care system due to increased morbidity and greater need for hospitalization and/or institutionalization. One way to prevent skeletal muscle loss is to improve dietary intake of the elderly. Both whey and casein seem to offer an anabolic advantage over soy protein for promoting muscle hypertrophy. As a consequence it is assumed that (all) plant based proteins have less potent anabolic properties when compared with animal based proteins. However, there is little theoretical background for such assumptions.

Objective: To provide evidence for the efficacy of wheat protein and wheat protein hydrolysate when compared with milk proteins (i.e. whey and casein) as a dietary protein to stimulate postprandial muscle protein synthesis in vivo in healthy older humans.

Study design: double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study Study population: 60 healthy non-obese (BMI 18.5-30 kg/m2) older males (age: 65-80 y) Intervention: A protein beverage (350 mL) containing 30 g of whey, casein, wheat protein, or wheat protein hydrolysate or 60 g of wheat protein hydrolysate will be consumed (n=12 per group).

Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary study parameters include muscle protein synthesis rates. Secondary study parameters include whole-body protein synthesis, breakdown, oxidation, and net balance.

Hypotheses: We hypothesize that ingestion of wheat protein hydrolysate results in a greater muscle protein synthetic response when compared with the intact wheat protein due to its faster digestion and absorption. Furthermore, ingestion of wheat protein hydrolysate results in a higher muscle protein synthetic response when compared with casein, but lower when compared with whey protein. Ingestion of 60 g of wheat protein hydrolysate (amount of leucine equal to 30 g of whey protein) will result in a similar muscle protein synthetic response compared to ingestion of 30 g of whey protein.",60,MALE,65 Years,80 Years

NCT03637439,['Hamstring Contractures'],2018-08-11,"The flexibility of the hamstrings is a very important component both for general health and when exercising.

In addition, the decrease in the flexibility of the hamstring musculature is also related to the increased likelihood of suffering muscle strains, patellar tendon tendinopathies, femoropatellar syndrome and decreased lumbopelvic rhythm.

Clinically, an invasive technique has appeared, known as Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous Neuromodulation (PNM). This minimally invasive intervention consists in the application of a percutaneous electrical stimulation (PES) through an acupuncture needle-like electrode that is placed in close proximity to the nerve or motor point of the muscle with ultrasound guidance. At the clinical level, the PES is always used with the therapeutic aim of relieving chronic pain and neuropathic pain. Similarly, in sports, PES is used with the aim of improving muscular activity.

OBJECTIVE:The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between previous injury history and on-ice and off-ice performance of elite male ice hockey players.

METHODS: This study was designed as prospective cross-sectional study. Fifty elite men's ice hokey players included (n=50, mean age 23y 8mo, SD 5y 3mo). Off-ice performance measures were 30 m Sprint Test, Broad Jump Test, Push-up Test, Hexagon Agility Test, Plank Test. The 2 on-ice tests were 30m On-ice Sprint Test and Cornering ""S"" Turn Agility Test.The athletes' history of injury were including previous injury site, type, number and the mechanism of injury. RESULTS: In push up test, there was a significant difference in those who had left hand and right knee injuries and, athletes who had dislocation were found to be statistically significant (p \<0.05). According to cornering s turn agility test results, athletes who had puck injury were found to be statistically significant (p \<0.05). In 30m sprint and hexagon agility test results, athletes who had overuse injury were found to be statistically significant (p \<0.05). There was a significant correlation between on-ice 30m sprint and cornering s turn agility tests with broad jump test and also with off-ice push-up and plank tests (p\<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the performance tests, push up test might be a distinctive test in determining the performance of the athletes after injury. Also on-ice tests had a correlation with off-ice plank test which is the indicator of core muscle strength.",50,MALE,18 Years,25 Years

NCT00001848,"['Endometriosis', 'Pelvic Pain']",N/A,"Many women with lower abdominal pain have endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) is found outside of the uterus. The diagnosis of endometriosis is usually made at surgery. The treatment of endometriosis includes medical and surgical approaches alone or in combination. The hormone estrogen stimulates the growth of the endometrium and may also stimulate the growth of endometriosis. Medical therapies that act to decrease the level of estrogen can reduce the amount of endometriosis and pain. When therapies are discontinued, symptoms often return. In addition, medical treatment for endometriosis is expensive and is often associated with weak bones (osteoporosis) and hot flashes as a result of low levels of estrogen.

Surgical treatment is removal or destruction of the endometriosis tissue. Studies show the pain from endometriosis is relieved longer with tissue removal than with destruction.

This study was developed to see if surgery followed by daily doses of Raloxifene (Evista) is effective in reducing pain, for a longer time than surgery in combination with a placebo (inactive ""sugar pill"") treatment. Raloxifene acts like estrogens in some tissues and not like estrogens in others. Postmenopausal women receiving Raloxifene for the prevention of osteoporosis had an increase in bone density and an improvement of their blood lipids (fat content in the blood). However, unlike estrogen, Raloxifene does not promote the growth of breast tissue or the uterus. If Raloxifene blocks estrogen action in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) of reproductive age women, as it does in post-menopausal women, it may also limit the growth of endometriosis and prevent the return of pain.",612,FEMALE,N/A,N/A

The majority (88%) of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where screening and prevention services are limited. Prevention of cervical cancer by identification and treatment of cervical cancer precursors is key, since treatment resources for invasive disease are scarce. A cervical cancer screening program cannot be effective unless it is linked with a proven intervention to prevent the development of cervical cancer.

Interferons (IFNs) are pleiotropic cytokines that involve in immunoregulatory, anticancer and restricting infection. Especially, type I IFN signaling is reported favourable for the success of conventional chemotherapeutics, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. In addition, type I IFN can regulate the activity of almost all immune cell types (including T cells, macrophages and innate lymphocytes), creating a well-established immune environment to defense infectious and relapsing disease. Implants are rapidly coated with extracellular matrix proteins and immune protein components for the formation of a typical capsule. At the specific time point before implantation, the locally utilized of IFN in intracavity breast is assumed to modify cellular immune responses thus contributing to decreasing infection and tumor recurrence.

However, the literature is scarce regarding the influence of dual-task training on changes in gait parameters.

The purpose of this prospective, blinded randomized controlled trial is to compare the short- and long-term effects of dual-task and aerobic training on gait stride variability and superior cerebral functions of independent community-dwelling elderly women.

The participants will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control groups.The experimental group will undertake 50 minutes/day of dual-task training, three times/week over 12 weeks, totaling 36 sessions, whereas the control group will receive the same doses of aerobic training. At baseline, after 18 and 36 sessions, and 12 weeks after the cessation of the interventions, researchers blinded to group allocations will collect the outcome measures.The interventions will be delivered by trained physical therapists.

Primary outcome will include gait stride variability, which will be assessed by a movement analysis system: the GaitRite® system, during cognitive and motor dual-tasks, at both normal and fast speeds. Secondary outcome measures will include a battery of global and specific cognitive function tests.

The findings of this trial may help better understand whether cognitive-motor interventions with older adults, when compared to traditional aerobic training, would result in greater improvements in gait under dual-task conditions and lead to improvements in cognitive tasks.

Compliance is problematic in that estimates show only 1/3 of women use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and only 30% are compliant. Estrogen has many documented benefits including symptomatic relief of hot flashes, improvement of the dry vagina and dyspareunia. Estrogen has been found to improve bone mineral density and increase the high- density lipoprotein portion of a cholesterol panel. To improve compliance and to provide an alternate method of delivery, we propose the use of estrogen which is admixed in toothpaste and propose to study the absorption, rate of build-up and rate of decline.

Hypothesis: Estrogen can potentially be absorbed systemically when toothpaste is admixed with estradiol and is applied in a timed, consistent fashion to postmenopausal or surgically postmenopausal women, not on HRT. Absorption takes place across the buccal mucosa.

Specific Aims:1) To estimate the systemic absorption of estrogen from daily use of estrogen containing toothpaste.

NCT01948557,['HIV'],2005-09,"Short courses of drugs can be given to HIV-infected pregnant women to reduce the chance of HIV infection being passed to her child either during pregnancy or during the labour process. However, children can also become infected by drinking the mother's breastmilk which contains the HIV virus. In many poor, developing countries in Africa, breastfeeding is the normal way of infant feeding and is vitally important because of the protection it gives to children from other diseases such as diarrhoea and malnutrition. Ideally there would be a way to make breastfeeding safer from HIV transmission without losing its other advantages.

A medical study recently suggested that HIV-infected women who exclusively breastfed their children i.e. gave breastmilk but without any water, tea, formula milk or any solid foods did not pass on the virus to their children to the same degree as women who MBF with these other fluids and foods. It is important to confirm whether this observation is in fact true or not. We hypothesize that exclusive breastfeeding by HIV-infected mothers carries a lower risk of HIV transmission than mixed breastfeeding.

We propose to follow 2,100 HIV-infected pregnant women and also some HIV-uninfected women from the time that they book at the clinic until 24 months of age. HIV-infected women who say they intend to breastfeed and all the HIV-uninfected women will be visited at their homes by breastfeeding counsellors both before and after delivery to support exclusive breastfeeding. HIV-infected women who choose not to breastfeed will be helped by clinic staff to safely replace all breastmilk with some other milk. An independent team will visit all mothers at their homes and collect information about the way they feed their children. Blood samples will be collected from the children at different times by a simple heel prick and the blood stored on a piece of filter paper.

NCT04098926,"['Breast Cancer', 'Radiotherapy']",2018-07,"Adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer improves local control, also in the elderly. Hormonal therapy in hormone sensitive tumors improves results but can not substitute radiotherapy. Improved local control leads to less breast cancer related morbidity and mortality, also in an older population (Schonberg, JCO, 2011).

Unfortunately, in older patients with lower life expectancy, adjuvant radiotherapy is often omitted. Following reasons are invoked:

* frailty of the patient
* fear for toxicity
* impaired mobility, rendering transportation and positioning more difficult
* dependency for transportation to and from the radiotherapy departement
* negative cost effectiveness ratio, due to high cost (especially for complex techniques and long schedules) and lower benefit (lower life expectancy)

Hypofractionation is feasible without increased toxicity, and combines better local control with patient comfort and lower costs. Further lowering the number of fractions (from 15-21 to 5) will further improve patient comfort, but is challenging when different doses are needed in the same target volume. This problem is addressed using advanced techniques permitting dose-integration.

NCT03031457,"['Breast Reconstruction', 'Venous Thromboembolism']",2017-12-15,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and continues to be a major patient safety issue after reconstructive plastic surgery. Significant morbidity and mortality is associated with VTE events. This disease entity represents the most common cause of preventable in-hospital death as evidenced by over 100,000 annual VTE-related deaths in the U.S. The associated economic burden is substantial, with annual costs to the U.S. healthcare system in excess of $7 billion.

Cancer patients have been identified as a particularly vulnerable patient population. Of these, breast cancer patients represent the largest group treated by plastic surgeons. An increasing number of breast reconstructions are performed in the U.S. with a documented 35% increase in the annual number of breast reconstructions since 2000. Over 106,000 breast reconstructions were performed in 2015 alone.

Of all reconstructive modalities, autologous breast reconstruction using abdominal flaps is associated with the highest risk for VTE. We believe that a key element rendering these patients susceptible to postoperative VTE is inadequate duration of chemoprophylaxis. This is supported by the observation that VTE risk remains elevated for up to 12 weeks postoperatively. We hypothesize that lower extremity deep venous system stasis is a procedure-specific key contributing factor to postoperative VTE risk.

NCT02698748,['Malaria'],2015-04,"One of the proposed ideas for malaria elimination includes the use of drugs to interrupt malaria transmission by exhausting the human reservoir of infection. Theoretically, mass treatment of an entire population with a very effective and rapid-acting drug (for instance an ACT), followed by the administration of an effective prophylactic regime during a minimum of four weeks, so as to outlast the typical development period of Plasmodium parasites in Anopheline mosquitoes, could achieve the same objective. In this respect, chloroquine (CQ) would be an appropriate candidate. This drug exhibits two conditions that make it attractive for elimination campaigns: 1) It has been demonstrated to have an excellent safety profile, allowing for its use in all age groups including pregnant women and children; and 2) Its relatively long elimination half life (t1/2=1-2 months) can provide a long post-treatment prophylactic effect. Recent evidence suggests that CQ sensitivity may be returning in places where discontinuation has reduced the drug pressure to the parasite populations. In countries such as Malawi, P. falciparum seems to have regained full sensitivity to CQ, and molecular markers of antiCQ resistance have nearly disappeared. While this does not support the reintroduction of CQ as first line therapy, it does suggest that, if proven sensitive in a given area, it could play a prophylactic role in malaria elimination strategies when used in combination with other drugs or tools. Thus, we intend to evaluate the potential role of chloroquine in preventing infections during elimination campaigns by performing a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in asymptomatic Mozambican adults.

Choosing asymptomatic parasitaemic adult males from a malaria-endemic area as our study population introduces limited risks when administering a drug with an uncertain efficacy (47% efficacious in 2001-2002). In malaria-endemic areas, this age group has a remarkably low risk of developing severe disease (irrespective of clinical symptoms), and it is foreseeable that parasitemia may be well tolerated, and in certain cases, spontaneously cleared from the individual's blood as a result of the immune system. In the unlikely event of any clinical symptomatology appearing throughout the follow-up, individuals will be examined by a study clinician and treated immediately with the country's first-line malaria treatment (artemether-lumefantrine, Coartem ®).",75,MALE,18 Years,N/A

Introduction The global burden of hypertension is huge. This project focuses on the role of potassium in human blood pressure regulation. A potassium rich diet lowers blood pressure and some studies have shown an increase in blood pressure during potassium depletion. Thus an inverse correlation between potassium intake and blood pressure exists. In this trial the objective is to test how an oral potassium supplementation, administered in form of the drug Kaleorid®, interacts with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system.

Methods This is a randomized clinical placebo-controlled double-blinded crossover trial. A group of healthy men will be randomized to either 4 weeks treatment with the drug Kaleorid®, 750mg, 3 tablets 3 times daily or to 4 weeks treatment with placebo.

On day 26 in the first treatment period the participants meet at the hospital to start a 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure and collect a 48-hours urine sample. The same day a blood sample, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a fat biopsy from the gluteal region will be done. The fat biopsy is expected to contain resistance vessels, which are to be investigated further in the laboratory.

On day 28 in the first treatment period the participants meet at the hospital again and are tested with an intravenous Angiotensin II infusion followed by continuous measurement of blood pressure and the following aldosterone response (using blood samples). Blood pressure will be measured with Finger Plethysmography and vascular tonus will be evaluated with the use of Impedance Cardiography, Finger Plethysmography and Doppler Ultrasound measurements of blood flow before, during and after the Angiotensin II infusion.

After this first period of treatment and testing a ""washout"" period of two weeks is inserted. After ""washout"", the participants crossover and starts the second treatment period.

Feasibility All necessary authorities have approved the trial and all cooperation is established.",25,MALE,20 Years,55 Years

NCT01621230,['Pregnancy'],2012-07,"The aim of this study is to measure the effects of bupivacaine administered via epidural catheters on indices of motor blockade ascertained during the second stage of labor. This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to address the primary research question: Does bupivacaine lengthen the second stage of labor? The secondary research question is: Is there other evidence of motor blockade attributable to bupivacaine during the second stage of labor?

The investigators know from prior studies that the length of the second stage in nulliparous women delivered at Parkland Hospital without epidural analgesia is 28 minutes. The investigators hypothesize in this now proposed study that epidural analgesia with bupivacaine will significantly increase this baseline from 28 minutes to 37 minutes or more (a 33% increase) thus implicating motor blockade. Baseline data for the Bromage and Breen scores during the second stage as well as the uterine contractility data are not available as these indices of motor blockade have not here-to-fore been studied in this context.

Currently at Parkland Hospital, 82% of nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor at term receive continuous epidural infusions with bupivacaine during the first and second stages of labor. Such women will be identified when admitted for scheduled inductions at Parkland. After informed consent is obtained standard management of labor induction will be provided. Those consented women reaching 8 cm cervical dilation will be randomized. Group I will receive bupivacaine plus fentanyl via epidural catheter during the second stage (i.e. 10 cm dilation) and Group II will receive only fentanyl infusion via epidural catheter (see study procedure below). Both the patient and the caregiver will be blinded as to whether the patient is in the bupivacaine plus fentanyl arm or the fentanyl only arm.

NCT01378325,['Anesthetic Complication Spinal'],2013-01,"Rapid administration of crystalloid immediately after induction of spinal anesthesia (coload) to be more effective in terms of managing hypotension as compared to administering crystalloid before spinal anesthesia (preload).

Phenylehrine infusion is a safe and effective way to reduce incidence and frequency of hypotension during SA for cesarean delivery. Hypotension was virtually eliminated by use of high-dose prophylactic phenylephrine infusion at a rate of 100 µg/min and rapid crystalloid coload up to two liters (administration at the time of SA). However, incidence of reactive hypertension was frequent up to 47% with decrease in maternal heart rate (HR). This may raise concern in patients in whom increase of blood pressure may be detrimental, like chronic hypertension and in the presence of a compromised uteroplacental blood flow. A recent study found that infusing phenylephrine at a fixed rate of 75 and 100 ug/min is associated with more episodes of hypertension than placebo or the lower infusion rates of 25 and 50 ug/min respectively. However, there was no reduction in the number of physician interventions (phenylephrine boluses and stopping the infusion) needed to maintain maternal systolic blood pressure within 20% of baseline among all groups. Prophylactic fixed rate infusions may have limited application in clinical practice, and a variable rate (i.e. modifying the rate according to hemodynamics) has been advocated. The bolus administration of phenylephrine to treat hypotension is still commonly used, but requests multiple interventions from the anesthesiologists and is time consuming.

Eighty patients scheduled for cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia will be assigned to one of two groups. Immediately after spinal injection, rapid crystalloid colaod of lactated Ringer of 15 mL/kg over a period of 10-15 min will be initiated. Patients in Group I will receive infusion of normal saline (placebo) and patients in group II variable infusion rate of phenylephrine started at 0.75 ug/kg (close to the dose of 50 ug/min recommended for fixed infusion rate). The number of interventions needed to maintain maternal systolic blood pressure within 20% of baseline, hemodynamic performance, intraoperative nausea and vomiting, and umbilical cord blood gases will be compared between the two groups.

NCT00100230,"['Retinitis Pigmentosa', 'X-linked Genetic Diseases']",2012-05,"Purpose:

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is characterized by progressive loss of visual function due to specific genetic mutations. This trial is focused on patients with one of the most severe forms of the disease, X-linked inherited RP (XLRP). This disease is characterized by early onset (typically loss of night vision as a child) followed by loss of peripheral vision as a teenager and young adult. There is no male-to-male transmission of the disease in the family.

There is no cure for RP and treatment options are limited. Two clinical trials have not found a benefit from nutritional supplementation with the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), at low daily doses although there is evidence that it slows disease progression in certain instances. In this clinical trial, we propose that a high dose nutritional DHA supplement will slow the loss of visual function and preserve usable vision in patients with XLRP.

This study is a 4-year placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial meaning that patients have a 50-50 chance of receiving placebo or experimental treatment. A total of 66 patients will be enrolled; 33 will receive placebo and 33 will receive the treatment. Entry criteria include diagnosis of XLRP by an ophthalmologist, age 7 to 32 years, male, sufficient visual function such that disease progression can be followed for the entire duration of the trial, and a willingness to visit the testing site (Dallas, TX) once a year.

Annual visual function testing includes ETDRS visual acuity, full-field and multifocal electroretinography (ERG), static peripheral visual fields, and fundus photography. Cone ERG function is the primary outcome measure.

NCT00275730,"['Ocular Physiology', 'Regional Blood Flow']",N/A,"Prostaglandins (PG) are known to alter regional ocular blood flow and exhibit vasoactive properties in isolated ocular blood vessels. A variety of animal experiments indicate that endogenous PGs play a role in the regulation of retinal (RBF) and choroidal (ChBF) blood flow. There is also evidence that the prostaglandin pathway is involved in the activation of NO production in humans, however, the mechanisms for interactions between PG and NO in ocular vasculature are still unclear.

Animal studies suggest that retinal and choroidal blood flow decrease after administration of indomethacin (a nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitor). More recently, it has been shown that indomethacin injected intravenously decreased optic nerve oxygen tension and reduced the CO2 reactivity. This is probably the result of decreased blood flow through vasoconstriction of vessels in the optic nerve. Systemic administration of indomethacin also diminishes cerebral, renal and mesenteric blood flow by an unknown mechanism.

NCT03520530,"['Dystocia; Fetal', 'Labor Long', 'Cesarean Section, Affecting Fetus or Newborn']",2019-12-01,"Shortening the second stage of labor, the time spent pushing the baby out, is important for positive mother and infant's outcomes. Lack of progress of labor for any reason is the most common reason for cesarean section in women having their first baby and the second most common reason for cesarean section in women who have already had a baby. In 2014, a large study done across the United States showed increases in complications in both mother and infant when pushing was prolonged, including uterine infection, postpartum hemorrhage, more extensive vaginal tearing, shoulder dystocia, 5 minute Apgar score less than 4, infant admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and neonatal infections. Therefore, the challenge is to consider alternative practices in order to maximize a mother's chance of a vaginal delivery and minimize these associated risks to both mother and baby.

Mouth guards are used primarily in contact sports, and have been demonstrated to reduce or prevent injury to the teeth. Additionally, it has been proposed that wearing a mouth guard increases the strength of different muscle groups. A recent randomized controlled pilot study including women with their first pregnancy using a dental support device (DSD) during the second stage of labor evaluated the length of the second stage and outcomes. They found a significant decrease of 38% in the length of pushing time in the group that used a DSD. Additionally, there was a decreased rate of cesarean section in this group, however a p-value was not reported. This study only included 64 patients. A second, larger trial did not find a significant difference in pushing time, however the rate of interventions such as a vacuum or forceps-assisted vaginal delivery and cesarean section were much higher in the control group due to prolonged pushing. The results of the second study are contradictory in nature, yet the researchers do not provide hypotheses into why this may be.

It is clear from the previously mentioned studies that further research is needed. Our hypothesis is that using such a device would help women to push more effectively during the second stage of labor thus shortening the time needed to push the baby out and increasing the rate of vaginal delivery. The purpose of this study is to determine whether wearing a mouth guard in the second stage of labor affects the length of the second stage of labor and improves mother \& infant outcomes.",154,FEMALE,18 Years,55 Years

Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark and Regional Hospital of Randers, Denmark

Population:

1200 women (600 in each group) stimulated in the latent phase of labour with oxytocin for induction

Methods:

The Syntocinon® infusion will be replaced with either continuous isotonic saline (placebo) or Syntocinon® infusion (control group), when the active phase of labour is reached.

Main outcome measures:

Caesarean section (primary outcome), tachysystole, neonatal asphyxia, birth experience

Syntocinon® is on the list high-alert medications and associated with complications for mother and child during labour. Reducing the duration of stimulation during labour may lower the number of asphyxial sequelae and the number of caesarean sections.",1200,FEMALE,18 Years,99 Years
NCT01014026,"['Uterine Cervical Neoplasms', 'Uterine Cervical Dysplasia']",2011-03,"Scientific Context

High-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the causative agents for cervical cancer. Cervical cancer screening strategies rely on periodic Papanicolaou (Pap) testing. It's well-known that this test has significantly contributed to the reduction of mortality and morbidity due to cervical cancer. In France, it now seems that the screening strategy could be optimized. The two main ways are to reach the 7 million underscreened women (mass screening, self-sampling for HPV DNA testing) and to improve the screening test (HPV DNA testing, computer-assisted cytology). Self-collected vaginal samples (SCVS) for HPV DNA testing could be a relevant screening option: this technique appears reliable and it could allow to reach women who are never or seldom screened. Currently, there is no French data on the SCVS for HPV DNA testing.

The goal of this study is to determine the performance and acceptability of a population-based strategy using self-collected vaginal samples for HPV DNA testing to reach women who are not participating in cervical cancer screening.

Description of the project

This project (APACHE-1) is a part of a project called APACHE. APACHE-1 will be dedicated to the SCVS technical validation and to the comparison between different transports medium. Nine hundred women will be recruited from the 20 to 65 years consultants in the Tours University Hospital (CHRU of Tours) and in the IRSA (health centre for routine medical checkup).

Each woman will collect 2 SCVS with a nylon flocked swab (Copan® microRheologics™). The first SCVS will be put in a vial which contains a liquid medium. The second SCVS will be put in a dry vial. Then during the speculum examination the physician will collect a cervical sample with a Rovers® Cervex-Brush™ and then rinse it into a vial containing PréservCyt ™. A blind HPV DNA testing and genotyping (Inno-LIPA HPV Genotyping ™ Extra) will be performed in the virology laboratory of the CHRU of Tours on all samples (SCVSs and cervical samples performed by a physician). The performance of the SCVS to detect cervical HPV infection will be assessed (gold standard test = HPV DNA testing on cervical samples collected by the physician).

In a second time (APACHE-2), the researchers will investigate to what extent offering home obtained SCVS leads to participation of unscreened women. APACHE-2 will be registered on Clinicaltrials as another project.",734,FEMALE,20 Years,65 Years

The primary goal of this treatment is to prevent the cancer from coming back (recurring) elsewhere in the body, but if it makes the cancer in the breast and lymph nodes shrink it might be easier to remove. This could allow a patient to have a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy and reduce the number of lymph nodes that the surgeon has to remove. In some cases, the neoadjuvant therapy works so well that it kills all of the cancer in the breast and lymph nodes. This is referred to as a pathologic complete response (pCR).

NCT02568657,['Postpartum Hemorrhage'],2015-10,"Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is responsible for around 25% of maternal mortality worldwide reaching as high as 60% in some countries.

Postpartum hemorrhage is defined as loss of 500 mL or more in a vaginal delivery and 1 Litre or more in a cesarean delivery.Also any blood loss that cause hemodynamic instability should be considered a PPH.

In 2012, WHO updated the guidelines for the management of PPH and retained placenta to include: ""The use of intrauterine balloon tamponade is recommended for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony. This recommendation is now stronger than the previous guidelines. It can be used for women who do not respond to uterotonics or if uterotonics are not available. This procedure potentially can avoid surgery and is appropriate while awaiting transfer to a higher-level facility"".Furthermore, FIGO included Uterine balloon tamponade as a recommended second-line intervention for the treatment of PPH in their updated guidelines issued in 2012.

In 2006, the ACOG Practice Bulletin, published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, made mention of the Bakri postpartum balloon for its specifically tailored design that enables conservative management of uterine bleeding in cases of uterine atony and other causes of PPH.

The reports demonstrated that balloon tamponade is helpful in managing PPH secondary to a wide variety of causes in resource-poor settings.

One of the new methods that could be used to control PPH is Uterine packing with chitosan-covered gauze or Celox.

Celox Haemostats are dressings with natural material called chitosan to control major haemorrhage including life-threatening bleeding . They are simple and effective, stopping major bleeding.It was first used by military forces to stop sever bleeding in the scene with no other options to stop bleeding. Celox™ granules are actually very high surface area flakes. When they come in contact with blood, Celox™ swells, gels, and sticks together to make a gel like clot, without generating any heat. Celox™ does not set off the normal clotting cascade, it only clots the blood it comes directly into contact with.

This action is due to stimulation of the receptor TGR5 by bile acids. Recently scientists have discovered that this receptor in rodents is also expressed on the surface of intestinal L-cells (which normally secrets Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) in response to nutrient stimulation). The stimulation of this receptor has shown a GLP-1 secretion from the intestinal cells which is interesting since GLP-1 has a central role in maintaining normal glucose tolerance and thus blood sugar. Given the above, bile acids has an important impact on intestinal GLP-1 secretion. Whether these scientific findings can be proven in human beings is uncertain.

NCT05675657,['Gynecologic Disease'],2023-07-15,"Postoperative pain following abdominal hysterectomy is a challenging concern as some patients suffer acute pain that could let to chronic pain over time following the surgery. Epidural analgesia which is the gold standard for postoperative pain management in abdominal surgeries including abdominal hysterectomy has side effects such as hypotension, hematoma, motor weakness of lower limbs, paresthesia, intrathecal placement of the epidural catheter and urinary retention that could prolong hospital stay. Since high frequency ultrasound machines' usage has increased in postoperative analgesia management, ultrasound guided fascial plane blocks has been performed by clinicians with high success rate. To avoid possible complications of epidural catheter placement and epidural analgesia, various techniques has been applying for an analgesic effect close to the effectiveness of epidural analgesia. These techniques include transversus abdominis plane block, rectus sheath block, wound infiltration of local anesthetics, erector spinae plane block and quadratus lumborum plane block. However, each of the plane blocks has limitations individually which prevent them to be the unique analgesic technique for postoperative analgesia following abdominal surgery.

Such modifications often lead to reduced physical-functional capacity in the elderly and increased risk of falls. Currently, physical exercise is widely used to improve physical performance and reduce, at least in part, postural instabilities and the risk of falls. In this context, the Pilates method may be a good strategy to improve body balance, muscle strength and, potentially, the perception of quality of life in this population, depending how the exercises are performed. This study seeks to assess whether practicing Pilates exercises in orthostatic position results in differential effects on walking mobility and postural balance in healthy elderly women when compared to the standard sequence in the Pilates method, which involves less time performing exercise in the orthostatic position.

NCT03326557,"['Labour, Induced', 'Vaginal Birth After Caesarean']",2018-08-30,"Nowadays, more and more women embark on pregnancy with previous Caesarean scar. One in five pregnancies requires induction of labour. The use of non-pharmacological methods (methods without using medication) has been gaining popularity for women who are not good candidates, such as women with previous Caesarean scar, for an induction with medications such as prostaglandin. Labour induction with prostaglandin carries higher risk of uterine rupture and thus it is not routinely offered to women with previous Caesarean delivery in Sibu Hospital. Non-pharmacological methods of induction of labour appear to be safe in women with previous Caesarean delivery. However, various methods are available and the efficacy among them remain in doubt.

In Sibu Hospital, membrane sweeping, which is a type of non-pharmacological method, is routinely offered to women with previous Caesarean delivery who require induction of labour. However, membrane sweeping may not exert its labour induction effect immediately and the delivery may be delayed by up to 8 days. This may render a proportion of women to resort to repeated Caesarean section for failed induction.

Transcervical Foley catheter insertion is another non-pharmacological methods for labour induction. Foley catheter, which is made from latex rubber, is inserted into the womb. The balloon will be inflated and this put pressure on the cervix and encourages dilatation. This method may successfully stimulates labour and the catheter falls out once the cervix dilates to 3 centimeters.

The benefits of the Foley catheter:

* A favourable and safe option for mothers who are hoping for a vaginal birth after Caesarean. It is estimated that 4-7 in 10 women with previous Caesarean undergoing labour induction with Foley catheter will have successful vaginal births.
* Cause the cervix to mechanically open without involving medication.
* Reduced risk of uterine rupture compared to induction with prostaglandin.
* Less risk of fetal distress compared to induction with prostaglandin.

The risks of Foley catheter:

* Vaginal bleeding (1.8%)
* Pain requiring removal of catheter (1.7%)
* Baby moving from head down to breech (1.3%)
* Fever (1%) which is lower than induction with prostaglandin.
* The risk of uterine rupture is similar to women undergoing spontaneous vaginal birth after Caesarean.

The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two types of non-pharmacological methods, ie. membrane sweeping and transcervical Foley catheter for induction of labour in women with previous Caesarean delivery.",60,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

NCT03548948,"['Colon Inflammation', 'Iron Malabsorption', 'Obesity', 'Diet Modification']",2018-11,"Obesity is an independent risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) although the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Dietary nutrients play a key role in both the prevention and promotion of CRC. While iron is an essential nutrient, excess iron is associated with carcinogenesis. Unlike the systemic compartment, the intestinal lumen lacks an efficient system to regulate iron. In conditions when dietary iron malabsorption and intestinal inflammation co-exist, greater luminal iron is associated with increased intestinal inflammation and a shift in the gut microbiota to more pro-inflammatory strains. However, treatments designed to reduce luminal, including diet restriction and chelation, are associated with lower intestinal inflammation and the colonization of protective gut microbes. Obesity is associated with inflammation-induced, hepcidin-mediated, iron metabolism dysfunction characterized by iron deficiency and dietary iron malabsorption. Obesity is also linked to intestinal inflammation. Currently, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how altered iron metabolism impacts CRC risk in obesity.

The investigator's objective is to conduct a crossover controlled feeding trial of: 1) a ""Typical American"" diet with ""high"" heme/non-heme iron"", 2) a ""Typical American"" diet with ""low"" iron, and 3) a Mediterranean diet with ""high"" non heme iron and examine effects on colonic and systemic inflammation and the gut microbiome.",17,FEMALE,55 Years,70 Years

Type 2 diabetes is often linked to obesity, which can increase insulin resistance. Meteorin-like protein (METRNL) is a new secreted protein that affects insulin sensitivity and has been found to be negatively related to serum glucose levels in people with diabetes.

Oxidative stress in diabetics can stimulate the production of inflammatory mediators, increasing the activity of the antioxidant system. Aloe vera, a widely used plant, has been used for treating diabetes, wound healing, tumors, and inflammatory bowel disease. It has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, antidepressant, and memory-enhancing effects.

Exercise can improve diabetic patients' conditions by increasing the expression of GLUT4 protein and skeletal muscle. High-intensity interval training has been shown to increase the expression of the METORIN gene in human subjects and decrease MDA in type 2 diabetic patients. However, no studies have examined the simultaneous effect of exercise and Aloe vera on diabetes indicators.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols designed to teach patients strategies to increase their sense of self-efficacy to manage symptoms may be helpful in alleviating multiple cancer-related symptoms. The efficacy of CBT protocols for reducing distinct symptoms in early-stage breast cancer has been shown; however the role of CBT protocols for multiple symptoms in late-stage cancer is less clear. The current study aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability as well as obtain an initial estimate of efficacy of a novel, cross-cultural CBT intervention that addresses multiple symptoms in advanced breast cancer patients. The target outcomes of intervention will be reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression, pain, and fatigue.

NCT01835457,['Autoimmune Diseases'],2013-06,"Auto-immune diseases are characterized by an inappropriate inflammatory response against tissues in the body and represent a major health care burden. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β play a central role in the pathophysiology of many auto-immune diseases. Innovative therapies aimed at limiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production in a more physiological manner are warranted. In previous research conducted in an individual known as ""the iceman"", the investigators found that, through a autodidact concentration/meditation technique, he appears to mount a controlled stress response, characterized by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and enhanced production of cortisol, both of which are known to result in immunosuppression. In accordance, while practicing this concentration/meditation technique, the inflammatory response during human endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide \[LPS\] administration) was remarkably low in this individual. Therefore, this technique could provide a novel means of controlling the inflammatory response. However, the aforementioned results were obtained in just one subject, and hence can not serve as scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the concentration/meditation technique. The iceman claims that he can teach this technique to other subjects within a relatively short time frame.

NCT01164657,['Parturition'],2006-05,"Background:

The World Health Organization (WHO) advises against recumbent or supine position for longer periods during labour and birth and states that caregivers should encourage and support the woman to take the position she finds most comfortable. It has been suggested that upright positions may improve childbirth outcomes and reduce the risk for instrumental delivery.

Objective:

The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that birthing on the ""BirthRite"" ® seat will result in a reduction in the number of primiparous women delivered instrumentally.

Method:

A power calculation showed (α = 0.05 β = 0.2) a requirement of 460 participants in each of the two arms of the trial in order to test for a 40% reduction (from 15% to 9%) of instrumental deliveries in primiparous women at a maternity unit in southern Sweden. It was decided to subject the study to a feasibility test by conducting a pilot-study in which 68 women were randomised to give birth on the birthing seat or to give birth in any other position but on the ""BirthRite"" ® seat. Randomization to birth on the birthing seat or in any other position took place when the participant's cervix was fully dilated. The primary outcome measurement was the number of instrumental deliveries. Secondary outcome measurements included oxytocin augmentation, perineal trauma, and blood loss administration of oxytocin for augmentation of labour, length of the second stage of labour, perineal trauma, perineal oedema, maternal blood loss and haemoglobin, apgar scores, cord pH and transfers to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit(NICU).",68,FEMALE,N/A,N/A

NCT00454948,['Obesity'],2008-08,"Obesity among Mexican-American women has the potential to become a public health crisis. Hispanics are one of the fastest growing minority populations in the United States and the prevalence of obesity in Mexican American woman is increasing at an alarming rate. Poor dietary practices, especially food habits that are acquired as families acculturate to the American food supply, and lack of exercise are thought to be associated with women's excess weight gain. Accordingly, interventions are needed to improve the dietary intake and physical activity levels of Mexican-American families.

We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which women are randomly assigned to receive either family-based behavioral counseling (FBC) sessions and play group physical activity sessions or group based nutrition and exercise classes and health related activity worksheets to complete with their child. The FBC sessions, conducted by community health advisors, will use photographs of the family's food practices, taken by mothers, as visual aids in the counseling sessions. The control intervention will consist of group sessions using curricula designed to motivate women to exercise and to promote the Food Guide Pyramid recommendations using traditional Mexican-American foods. The primary outcome of the trial is mother's BMI. The secondary outcomes are dietary intake, moderate to vigorous physical activity and household food supplies. We hypothesize that within a one year time frame, women who are exposed to the FBC will have lower BMI's compared to women who receive the active placebo control intervention. The mechanisms through which we intend to change weight status are altering the type of foods purchased and cooking practices and promoting mothers to engage in physical activities with their children during their play. Measurements of secondary outcomes include three 24 hour dietary recalls, a household food inventory and activity monitoring using MTI actigraph monitors. In addition, mothers' reports of household food security level, and food purchase motives, will be collected as covariates.

It complicates up to 11% of all pregnancies and it is responsible for 70% of sick babies. The ideal way to stop preterm labor when it occurs (which drug to use) is not known. Currently magnesium sulfate is used by about 95% of all practitioners, but recent data suggest magnesium given this way may be harmful for the baby's future development. Other drugs such as antiprostaglandin agents are very effective in stopping uterine activity, but particularly when used for \>48 hours have been associated with both maternal and fetal sides effects. Lastly, calcium channel antagonists are effective in stopping contractions and have very little in the way of maternal and fetal side effects, but less data is available in the United States on their use. Because there is no FDA approved drug to stop preterm labor, we purpose to randomize all women with preterm labor (20-34 weeks) to receive one of the above three methods of stopping preterm labor. The primary outcomes will be to see which agent stops the uterine contractions most effectively, for the longest period of time with fewest relapses and results in significant prolongation of pregnancy. If one of these agents is clearly superior to the other two it would help women avoid early delivery or have significant extension of their pregnancy to avoid some of the complications of preterm birth in the baby.",301,FEMALE,16 Years,45 Years

NCT02083848,['Cervical Cancer'],2015-11,"Background of the study: The accurate assessment of local cervical cancer spread (i.e. invasion) is of clinical importance for staging and treatment considerations. For example, if parametrial invasion is absent, radical surgery is the treatment of choice for tumors less than 4cm in diameter. However, if such invasion is present, the patient has become inoperable and (chemo)radiotherapy is warranted. Unfortunately, regular 1.5T MRI as a part of staging work-up has a limited accuracy for detecting loco-regional tumor invasion. Due to relatively frequent false-negative findings a risk of understaging and under-treatment occurs. For such cases adjuvant treatments with (chemo)radiotherapy are indicated after the initial surgery, causing increased morbidity and treatment associated risks. For higher stages, with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, a more reliable MRI based delineation of local tumor spread could enable individualized dose(volume) and field modifications.

NCT00942565,['Postoperative Pain'],2008-10,"Patient experience moderate to severe pain after abdominal surgery. This post-operative pain can also contribute to complications such as respiratory impairment, cardiovascular events, ileus, sleep deprivation and mood disturbance. Opioid based patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is commonly employed but opioids have the side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, sedation, pruritus and urinary retention. Bowel motility can also be affected. Consequently alternative or adjunct analgesic medications without these side-effects have been investigated in order to reduce opioid consumption.

Multimodal analgesia is a technique whereby a combination of analgesic drugs with different modes of action can be used to improve analgesia and decrease adverse effects by virtue of synergism. Postoperatively, with adjunctive analgesia, PCA morphine consumption as well as the side effects may be reduced. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be opioid sparing and decrease the adverse effects of PCA morphine. A recent review showed that acetaminophen combined with PCA could induce a significant opioid-sparing effect but the incidence of PCA morphine related side effects were not reduced.

It is common nowadays to give oral analgesic supplements to post-operative patients on PCA morphine. Tramadol, an analogue of codeine, is one of the choices. However, some of the patients cannot tolerate the side effects such as nausea, drowsiness, sweating, postural hypotension and dry mouth. Combination of tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 375 mg, which has been used successfully to treat post-operative pain, may improve analgesic response with better tolerability.

NCT04170465,['Breast Cancer Female'],2022-04-02,"Metformin, the widely prescribed oral hypoglycemic drug, is well known for its established efficacy, favorable safety profile, and low cost. Metformin has recently received increasing attention because of its potential antitumorigenic effects that are thought to be independent of its hypoglycemic effects. It has been extensively studied in preclinical models, which have implicated several molecular pathways in its antitumor activity.

Metformin was proved to have anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on tumor cells.Moreover, metformin enhances the T-cell mediated immune response to tumor tissue and fights metastases. Also, epidemiological studies have shown that metformin, but not other antidiabetic drugs, reduces cancer incidence and improves survivability in diabetic cancer patients.

The proposed research in this application will investigate two prime questions with regards to the combined use of metformin together with traditional neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. First, the hypothesis that the simultaneous use of metformin along with doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel neoadjuvant protocol produces better antitumor outcomes will be tested.

This test has been used for about the last 30 years with good safety and efficacy. The ultrasound evaluation includes monitoring fetal breathing, fetal gross and fine movement and amniotic fluid evaluation. NST and BPP have been found to have similar ability to predict fetal well-being, with similar safety and ease of performance.

NCT03313830,['Healthy'],2020-11-06,"Muscle protein synthesis can be stimulated by ingestion of protein sources, such as whey, casein or soy. Protein supplementation can be useful to restore protein turnover after exercise but also to preserve skeletal muscle mass and function in aging adults. Ingestion of large doses of essential amino acids (EAA) or certain protein supplements may be an effective strategy to induce muscle protein synthesis. However, in many cases, it may not be practical or feasible to consume a large volume of amino acids or protein required for an effective response by muscle. Several evidences show how reduced strength and muscle mass, even in early life, are predictors of early mortality which explicit the importance of developing more effective methods to improve muscle quality. Therefore, identifying the better sources of protein that have higher anabolic potency is of high significance.

The goal of this study is to determine the anabolic potency and efficacy of a new and novel Whey Protein Hydrolysate mixture (WPH) on skeletal muscle protein synthesis in healthy young subjects (age 20-35 yr). Previous studies on rats indicate WPH induces significant increases in muscle protein synthesis compared with carbohydrates or whey-amino acid mixture. WPH contains mostly peptides, which have physiological effects and could be absorbed more rapidly. Preliminary data from preclinical study has also demonstrated that WPH can stimulate muscle protein synthesis at lower doses compared with intact whey proteins. Thus, WPH could be absorbed more rapidly and may maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Although there is substantial data on the individual effects of BCCA and intact protein such as whey, there have been no clinical investigations that have explored the efficacy of WPH for stimulating muscle protein synthesis in humans.

Therefore, the investigators propose that WPH will increase muscle protein synthesis.

They will compare the response of WHP to the response of WHEY when equal protein is provided in both treatments.

10 healthy subjects will be recruited and will receive both WPH and WHEY supplementation in a single blind crossover design. Muscle protein synthesis will be measured on both occasions. This acute study will allow to determine whether low dose WPH supplementation will be an effective nutritional treatment to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in young adults.",11,MALE,20 Years,35 Years

NCT03900130,"['Satiation', 'Appetite', 'Behavior', 'Hunger']",2019-04-01,"Designing food and drink that maximizes satiety has long been an ambition of industry and public health.

For obvious reasons, foods that fill faster and for longer are desirable to consumers for controlling their weight, and to public health programs that are designed to prevent obesity.

Current methods for measuring satiety have weak predictive value, commonly fail to replicate, and are yet to be validated with respect to energy consumption in everyday life.

The investigators propose to overcome this deficiency by developing the Omnibus Satiety Metric (OmniSaM).

OmniSaM is proposed as a multi-modal metric that targets the full spectrum of processes underlying the satiety cascade, composing brain, blood, mind and behavior of consumers.

The endogenously produced unconjugated bilirubin is one of the most powerful anti-oxidants of the human body and the administration of bilirubin in animal experiments has been shown to protect from inflammation-induced death. However, bilirubin for human administration is not yet available. Therefore, we wish to exploit one of the side effects of atazanavir, a registered drug currently used as a protease inhibitor in HIV infected patients. Atazanavir inhibits the enzyme UPD glucuronosyl transferase enzyme (UGT1A1) and therefore increases endogenously produced bilirubin levels moderately. To study the effect of hyperbilirubinemia during inflammation we will apply the human endotoxemia model. The human endotoxemia model permits elucidation of key players in the immune response to a gram negative stimulus in vivo, therefore serving as a useful tool to investigate potential novel therapeutic strategies in a standardized setting.

Miscarriage often brings not only physical pain, bleeding and risks of infection, but also psychological impacts on women and their families. This study will focus on women whose pregnancy sac remains inside the womb (known as a missed miscarriage) and opt for medical management of their miscarriage up to 13+6 weeks of pregnancy. NICE currently recommends that a drug called misoprostol (a vaginal pessary or oral tablet that makes the womb contract) should be used in the medical treatment of miscarriage. However, there is evidence to suggest that combining this drug with mifepristone (an oral tablet that reduces pregnancy hormones) may be more effective in treating miscarriage. Therefore, to test this in a clinical trial, participants will be allocated at random to receive either mifepristone followed by misoprostol, or a dummy drug (placebo) followed by misoprostol. Neither the participants nor the researchers will know what allocation is decided, which is necessary to test the treatments fairly. The main outcome of interest will be whether miscarriage is complete within 7 days of randomisation. If miscarriage is not complete then further treatment (more tablets or surgery) will be offered. A number of other key outcomes, such as the need for an operation, will also be assessed. We will also study the views and experience of the participants regarding the tablet treatment.

We anticipate that 710 women will be required to take part in the study to answer this question with confidence. We estimate that we would be able to recruit this many women in two years.",711,FEMALE,16 Years,N/A

Despite the high initial response rates to hormonal therapy, the vast majority of men will develop cancer which is no longer responsive to hormone deprivation. The average time for hormonal therapy to be effective is about 18 months. Chemotherapy combinations which can treat the disease when it no longer responds to hormonal therapy have been developed, but these treatments are not curative. One of these combinations is estramustine, etoposide and paclitaxel. In men with far advanced disease, 60% will have a decrease in their PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) or shrinkage of tumors after treatment with this chemotherapy. Despite this, these men have all developed further disease progression requiring additional treatment. One possible way to make chemotherapy more effective is to give it when the number of tumor cells is smallest, and the number of cells to be killed is at a low level. One situation in which this is true is when a man has responded to hormonal therapy any tumors are at their smallest size.

NCT01672060,['Effectiveness of Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) in BC'],2021-12,"Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is a primary prevention program that was developed by Dr. David Olds in the United States (US) with the goal of helping vulnerable young first-time mothers and their children. The program involves public health nurses (PHNs) visiting mothers in their homes, providing intensive supports starting in pregnancy and continuing until children reach their second birthday. Studies in the US have shown that NFP significantly reduces child maltreatment and child behaviour problems, while also improving children's early learning and mother's economic self-sufficiency. Economic studies have also shown that the program pays for itself over the long-term. However, NFP has never been tested in Canada. Due to major differences in our populations and in our public services, we do not know whether NFP will show the same benefits here. We therefore plan to conduct a scientific evaluation of NFP's effectiveness in British Columbia (BC), in close collaboration with the BC government and BC's Health Authorities. Using randomized-controlled trial methods, NFP's effectiveness will be specifically evaluated in comparison with existing perinatal services in BC regarding outcomes across three fundamental domains: 1) pregnancy and birth; 2) child health and development; and 3) maternal health and life course.

NCT00244582,['Type 2 Gaucher Disease'],N/A,"This study will use an experimental method of delivering the enzyme glucocerebrosidase directly into the brain of a patient with Gaucher disease to treat disease symptoms. Patients with Gaucher disease have insufficient levels of glucocerebrosidase. As a result, substances normally broken down by this enzyme accumulate in the body, causing damage to the brain and other organs. Symptoms of Gaucher disease outside the brain can be treated by infusing the missing enzyme intravenously (IV, through a vein). However, IV infusions do not help the neurologic symptoms of the disease, because the enzyme cannot get into the brain. This study will use a new technique called convection-enhanced delivery to try to introduce glucocerebrosidase directly into the brain.

This single-patient study includes an 8-month-old male with Type 2 Gaucher disease with progressive neurological decline.

In preparation for the enzyme infusion, the patient will have a complete physical examination, including a detailed neurological examination, and blood and urine tests. On the day of surgery, the child will be placed under general anesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For this procedure, the child lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to protect his hearing from the loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. He will then be brought to the operating room for the infusion procedure, as follows:

An incision will be made in the scalp and a small hole drilled through the skull. Then, a small tube (cannula) will be positioned through the hole into the target area in the brain. Once the tip of the cannula is in place, it will be connected with tubing to a syringe filled with glucocerebrosidase in saline (salt water). The child will then have a second MRI scan to make sure the cannula is placed correctly and to monitor delivery of the glucocerebrosidase to the brain. The child will be monitored closely with MRI scans every 30 to 60 minutes during the infusion to look for fluid in the brain and determine the extent of the enzyme perfusion. The infusion will last no longer than 6 hours and will be stopped when the full dose of enzyme has been delivered. The cannula will be removed and the scalp incision closed. The child will stay in the hospital for observation from 4 to 10 days, with at least 24 hours in the intensive care unit and 3 to 7 days in the pediatric unit.

The child will be seen in the clinic two weeks after discharge and then once a month for 3 months to evaluate any possible effects of the surgery. These follow-up visits include a repeat MRI scan and neurological examination. After the first 3 months, visits may be less frequent.

If the child continues to have symptoms during the course of follow-up or his neurologic status worsens, additional enzyme infusions will be offered, possibly including treatment of the brainstem. If the child gains no benefit after three infusions have been performed, no additional infusions will be offered. If there appears to be any neurological benefit, additional infusions may be offered.",1,MALE,N/A,5 Years

To counteract the prevalence of WRMSD, human-robot interaction could improve the power of a person and reduce the physical strain. For the lower back, a reduction of spinal loading could be helpful. The passive upper-extremity exoskeleton Laevo® is developed to support physically heavy work: it supports the back during bending and should, consequently, result in less low back pain (Laevo®, the Netherlands).

OBJECTIVES The primary aim of this study is to assess to what extent wearing the exoskeleton changes:

* muscular activity of the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles;
* knee compression force;
* posture of the upper and lower spine, trunk, hips and knees; ...in different tasks (static vs. dynamic), different trunk postures (trunk flexion vs. trunk flexion and rotation) and different knee postures (straight vs. stooped).

Secondary aims of this study are to assess to what extent wearing the exoskeleton changes:

In this study, 600 young African American women, 18-24 years of age, who report 3 or more occasions where they drank alcohol in the past 90 days will be recruited to complete a four-part baseline assessment consisting of: 1. an audio computer assisted self interview (ACASI), 2. videotaped communication role plays to objectively measure communication skill ability (subsample), 3. provide a vaginal specimen to test for STDs and 4. Provide a urine pregnancy screen. After participants complete their baseline assessment, they will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1. Horizons+GMET alcohol-specific condition, 2. a time-equivalent Horizons+GHP condition, or 3. an enhanced standard-of-care control condition. The GMET alcohol-specific component has shown to be effective in influencing several alcohol-specific concepts (attitudes, norms, self-efficacy) and reducing sexual risk-taking among culturally-diverse high-risk youth. The GMET alcohol-specific module was designed to increase woman's awareness of the unfavorable effects of alcohol on themselves, their sexual decision-making, and their male partner and teaches women strategies to reduce the possibility of engaging in sex under the influence of alcohol. In addition, the GMET alcohol-specific module provides skills training needed to effectively talk about sexual intentions to use condoms and/or refuse risky sex when they or their male sex partner has been using alcohol. After completing one of the three conditions, participants will complete a brief ACASI posttest to evaluate immediate changes in hypothesized social and psychological mediators of safer sex and alcohol use. Participants will also return to complete follow-up assessments at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months after their intervention. If the Horizons+GMET intervention is observed to be effective, investigators will work closely with the CDC DEBI program to help distribute the intervention to public health agencies and community based organizations (CBOs).",560,FEMALE,18 Years,24 Years

Healthcare services have improved how they manage self-harm in the community and prisons. However, there has been little focus on the recovery of people with self-harm scars. Medical skin camouflage (MSC) is a British National Formulary-listed topical cream designed to cover skin conditions. Research on MSC has focused on its use with non-self-harm marks e.g. burns. The evidence from this research suggests that the cream helps women feel better and do more activities. There is little/no evidence about the effects of the preparation for women who self-harm and for prisoners.

This research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Research for Patient Benefit Programme. In the research the investigators will examine whether it is possible and practical to use MSC in prison. The investigators will ask women prisoners and staff what they think about the cream. The research has four parts. In the first part the investigators will run focus groups with women prisoners and prison staff to find out the best way to deliver the MSC intervention and how to measure its effects. In the second part the investigators will design a programme for delivering the MSC. The investigators will then train 6-10 long-term prisoners to become skin camouflage practitioners. The final part will involve a small randomised controlled trial with 40 women prisoners; 20 will be allocated to the intervention group and will use the MSC for 6 weeks. The investigators will measure their mood, thoughts of self-harm and wellbeing before and after they use MSC. The investigators will compare these results with 20 women who have not used MSC (waitlist control group). All women taking part will be placed at random into the control or the treatment group. The control group will receive the MSC after the research has ended.

NCT02067520,['Pain'],2014-12,"Introduction:

Cesarean section (C/S) is usually performed under spinal with preservative free morphine for pain relief, but the investigators have a severe shortage of this formulation of morphine. Hydromorphone is a narcotic which acts peripherally and centrally to decrease pain. It has been used in spinals for postoperative pain relief and in pain pumps for relief of chronic pain. No randomized controlled studies have evaluated intrathecal (IT) hydromorphone for post C/S pain.

Methods:

This is a randomized double-blind controlled trial utilizing the up-down sequential allocation method1,2 to find the best dose of IT hydromorphone that provides pain relief following C/S. Patients will be given a morphine PCA pump for additional pain relief. Our first patient will receive 200 mcg of IT hydromorphone. Pain, nausea, and itching will be evaluated at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours following the C/S via numeric rating scales; vomiting and morphine use per hour will be recorded. Success will be a median morphine usage of less than or equal to 1mg/hour in the following 16 hours. If a success, the next patient will be given 10 mcg less IT hydromorphone; if a failure, she will receive 10 mcg more. The study will end after 5 successes.

Objective:

The primary objective is to find the optimal dose of IT hydromorphone for pain relief following C/S. The secondary objectives are to define the incidence and severity of hydromorphone's side effects and determine the duration of analgesia.",54,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

Performance declines are more pronounced in hot conditions or after prolonged strenuous activity such as exercise. Most individuals drink less than their sweat losses during activity, while some individuals overdrink and develop a sodium deficiency. Water and electrolyte balance must be restored as part of the recovery process after any activity that causes sweating. Plain water causes a decrease in plasma sodium concentration and osmolality, which reduces the desire to drink and increases urine production. Unless the volume ingested exceeds the loss, individuals are in net negative fluid balance throughout the recovery period due to urinary losses. When sodium and potassium are added to rehydration fluids, urine production is reduced in the hours following rehydration. Rehydration is only possible if a volume of fluid equal to or greater than the amount lost through sweat is consumed, together with adequate electrolytes. The two test products for this study, are novel hydration beverage formulas. They are an electrolyte drink mixture with five essential vitamins and three times more electrolytes than typical sports beverages.

NCT04456920,"['Breast Cancer', 'Biopsy Wound']",2023-11-20,"Each year, approximately 1500 breast biopsies (1000 microbiopsies and 500 macrobiopsies) are performed in the radiologic department of the Montpellier Cancer Institute (ICM). This exam, which is relatively easy for the radiologist, can however lead to major anxiety for patients. Indeed, previous studies show that about 50% of women undergoing a breast biopsy have significant anxiety affects.

Anxiety associated with the risks of biopsy, potential breast cancer diagnosis and/or lack of routine sedation procedures increase patient concerns. Distress prior to biopsy is associated with greater pain and discomfort during the procedure. The psychological distress that persists after the biopsy is related to a worse psychological management of side effects of the biopsy breast (e.g., sensitivity, skin irritation).

Limiting apprehension, worry and anxiety induced by the uncertainty linked to the biopsy results and the biopsy-related pain should be an integral part of the medical care through the patient follow-up during, after and until the diagnosis is announced. In light of these challenges, new alternative methods are emerging to enhance patient knowledge, develop procedural skills, improve confidence and mitigate procedural anxiety. However, to our knowledge, few methods have been developed during this period of 'waiting-time'. Currently, only care instructions and a consultation to announce the results (about 10 days after the procedure) are proposed to patients at the end of biopsy. Patients are also encouraged to call if they suspect complications such as infection or bleeding.

In this context, the investigators propose to integrate a pain management after biopsy via e-health system through the patient's medical care. Radiologist/patient communication could have an impact on patients' anxiety and health-related issues, given the challenging nature of discussions around need for breast biopsy and potential implications of the results. Indeed, paying attention and focusing on symptoms as patients experience them improves their empowerment and their adjustment to the disease.

Web-based systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been shown to prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control and to enhance patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being. In addition, it is known that improved communication between patients and medical staff to less anxiety after a biopsy and that anxiety is related to pain.

Taken as a whole, these elements encourage the integration of e-health and e-PRO for the management of pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a biopsy. The benefits of e-PRO are still being discussed in terms of quality of life (Qol) and psychological distress. The investigator propose to integrate two types of e-health intervention: 1/e-PRO collected by connected objects (smartphone or tablet) as they were used in previous studies, and 2/ e-PRO collected by a phone consultation, which values human communication between the medical staff and the patient.

In case of significant pain, the collection of e-PRO by any of these e-health interventions will generate an alert and a reactive and responsive care.

In fine, the purpose of this research is to improve the medical organization and care of post-biopsy patients by proposing an innovative connected patient technology, regardless of their remoteness from the hospital.

Previous attempts to get rid of the unhealthy bacteria with antibiotics have not shown to affect the risk of preterm birth. The reason for this may be that what is required is the replacement of Lactobacilli in the birth canal. This can be done by asking women to take capsules containing lactobacilli once daily. To study whether oral Lactobacilli capsules compared with dummy capsules can reduce the risk of preterm birth, a large study involving approximately 10,000 women would be required.

NCT01028482,['Postpartum Depression'],2010-11,"Introduction:

Postpartum depression (PPD) occurs in large numbers of women (between 10 - 20%) and substantially affects both their own well-being and their offspring's mental and emotional development. Whereas PPD is a form of major depression, its etiology is probably related to a combination of biological (hereditary, hormonal etc.), and psychological factors. In practice, most women suffering from PPD do not seek treatment, or are treated with psychotherapy alone due to concerns regarding pharmacotherapy. This is despite the obvious importance of reaching a rapid remission in these women. In fact, data regarding the treatment of PPD with antidepressants is surprisingly sparse and is limited to only one blinded and placebo-controlled study (with fluoxetine) and a number of studies without a placebo arm . The reason for the paucity of double-blinded placebo-controlled studies is probably due to 3 main limiting factors: Firstly, the reluctance of women to ""admit"" to and seek professional help due to depression, Secondly, the difficulty to administer antidepressant medication to lactating women, and, Thirdly, the ethical difficulties in designing a study with a real placebo group.

In contrast to the very limited number of drug studies in this population, there are a number of studies that have shown the efficacy of psychotherapy in the treatment of PPD. Positive studies have been published using different types of psychotherapy, including cognitive, dynamic and interpersonal psychotherapy.

The investigators propose to study the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatment in women suffering from PPD with add-on sertraline in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled design. To overcome the difficulties described above in studying antidepressants in the postpartum period, the investigators propose to include active brief dynamic psychotherapy for all women. Furthermore, the investigators will selectively allow inclusion of women who only suffer from either mild or moderate major PPD (not severe / suicidal) .

Hypothesis:

The investigators hypothesize that women with PPD randomized to the arm receiving psychotherapy + active sertraline will show a greater response rate than the psychotherapy + placebo group. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the difference in response between the 2 groups will demonstrate a significant early response in the active sertraline group.",42,FEMALE,18 Years,45 Years

This study aims to demonstrate that a glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), already in common use for other conditions, (eg to treat medical conditions such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis in early pregnancy), will reverse the endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency and as a result reduce menstrual blood loss.

The study is in two stages, a 12 month workup stage and a 3 year, response adaptive, dose-finding randomised controlled trial. The first stage involves two workup clinical studies to gather preliminary safety and efficacy data from first-in-Heavy Menstrual Bleeding use of oral dexamethasone. They will also provide methodological data for a series of simulation studies to determine a robust adaptive trial design specification.

Workup study 1: is unblinded, six patients will be given Dexamethasone (0.75mg twice daily) for 5 days during two consecutive menstrual cycles and will have an endometrial biopsy and MRI on two occasions (in a nontreated cycle, and the second of the cycles treated with Dexamethasone). Workup study 2; is a doubleblind crossover trial of 14 women -2 treatment blocks of two cycles each, with either placebo or Dexamethasone (0.75mg twice daily), randomised to order of treatments blocks - placebo then Dexamethasone, or vice-versa.

Adaptive trial: 54 month double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 108 women to evaluate the effect of Dexamethasone across a range of doses with the aim of identifying the optimal dose to be studied in a subsequent Phase III trial.

Participants will be randomised to receive one of 6 active doses or placebo over 3 menstrual cycles.

All studies will involve asking participants to complete menstrual diaries and to carry out menstrual blood loss collections to objectively measure blood loss.

NCT00909974,"['Intrauterine Growth Retardation', 'Low Birth Weight']",2008-12,"Low birth weight (LBW; birth weight\<2,500g) is the most important determinant of mortality and morbidity in the neonatal period. It is also a very important factor in predicting nutritional status, health and development in childhood. It even influences health in adult life, contributing to the vicious cycle of disease and poverty. The high rate LBW in DCs represents therefore a major public health problem. Maternal chronic energy deficiency is assumed to be a major determinant of the problem in these countries along with prenatal micronutrient deficiencies. A large body of recent evidence points out that multiple micronutrient supplementation as such has only a modest beneficial effect on fetal growth. Therefore, it is expected that providing these multiple micronutrients in a food supplement covering energy requirement needs of pregnant women will have an effect of public health importance on children's health.

This study has the objective of improving children's health by improving birth outcome and fetal growth through the provision of a food supplement enriched in multimicronutrients during pregnancy.

NCT01396720,['Drug Interactions Between Clopidogrel and Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors'],2012-12,"Clopidogrel is a platelets inhibitor that is widely used particularly during and after acute coronary events and coronary interventions. Several studies have shown that some patients are resistant to clopidogrel. The resistance mechanism is not entirely clear, but at least in part it is related to interactions between medications. Clopidogrel is a pro-drug converted in vivo to its active metabolite by CYP2C19 and CYP3A in the liver. Consequently drugs that inhibit the CYP2C19 can affect the production of the active metabolite and cause ""clopidogrel resistance"". Therefore the FDA has recently published a ""safety alert"" which recommends avoiding cross treatment with clopidogrel and drugs that are expected to inhibit CYP2C19 (including omeprazole, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, fluconazole and others). Nevertheless there no clear evidence in the literature for clinical relevance of such interactions.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are group of antidepressant drugs that are widely used for treatment of depression and anxiety. SSRIs are considered to be very safe with favorable side effect profile, hence many patient after coronary events who suffers from behavioral and emotional disturbances are treated with those drugs. However there are several reports that SSRIs can inhibit platelet function and increase bleeding tendency particularly in concomitant administration with aspirin. The proposed mechanism is blocking of platelets serotonin reuptake that result in platelet dysfunction.

Fluvoxamine - is a member in the SSRI family and a potent inhibitor of the CYP2C19. Theoretically fluvoxamine should have two conflicting effects on the response to clopidogrel. Pharmacokinetically it is expected to decrease the clopidogrel responsiveness due to inhibition of CYP2C19 and reduction in the production of the active metabolite. On the other hand ""pharmacodynamically"" fluvoxamine may directly inhibit platelet aggregation due its effect on serotonin reuptake, thus increasing the effect of clopidogrel. Other SSRIs that do not interact with the CYP2C19 such as citalophram are expected to have only pharmocodynamic effect on platelet aggregation.

Although both clopidogrel and SSRIs are widely used in the last decade and concomitant treatment is quite common, no data is available about in influence of the interaction between those drugs on platelet function and on clinical events. The net effect of fluvoxamine and other SSRIs on platelet function in the presence of clopidogrel is not known.

The aim of the investigators study is to assess the effect of two SSRIs fluvoxamine and citalophram on platelet aggregation and to test the effect of these drugs on the laboratory response to clopidogrel, in healthy individuals.

NCT01704274,['Prostate Cancer'],2017-01,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in Canada. Over 30% of men over the age of fifty have histological evidence of prostate cancer on biopsy. Despite the stage migration afforded by early detection with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing and an apparent trend toward improved survival over the past several years, prostate cancer remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Biochemical failure after primary therapy (surgery or radiation) remains a significant health care burden and strategies to delay clinical prostate cancer progression and prolong the interval from treatment failure to systemic therapy would be of significant clinical benefit for those men suffering from a finding of PSA recurrence.

PSA is widely accepted as the most useful prognostic marker of prostate cancer progression, particularly after primary therapy with radical surgery or radiation. 5 Despite improved cancer control rates with definitive management of early stage prostate cancer, a PSA recurrence is unfortunately a common occurrence (25-50%) in most large case series.

Microenvironmental factors have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the selection of neoplastic cell subpopulations expressing more malignant phenotypes and contributing to the progression of localized and metastatic disease. Very low levels of O2 (\< 10 mmHg) has been well described in many solid tumours (including prostate cancer) and the extent of hypoxia has been demonstrated to represent an independent marker of a poor prognosis for patients with various types of cancers. Tumour hypoxia contributes to numerous adaptive phenotypes including increased invasion and metastasis, as well as evasion of immune cell surveillance increased resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Although cellular adaptive responses to hypoxia are likely mediated by various mechanisms, our previous preclinical studies suggest that decreased nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signalling plays a significant role in this progression of a malignant phenotype.",43,MALE,18 Years,90 Years

NCT03296774,['Postpartum Care'],2017-02-15,"Minority women and women of lower socioeconomic status are at significantly increased risk of unintended pregnancies, short inter-pregnancy interval, and short duration of breastfeeding. The consequences of poorly timed pregnancies and short duration of breastfeeding for the health of mothers, infants and children are well documented.

To decrease rates of poorly timed pregnancies, increase breastfeeding duration and address other postpartum concerns women must be engaged in their postpartum care outside of the traditional postpartum visit. In addition to contraceptive counseling and breastfeeding support, providers discuss a number of important maternal and child health issues at the postpartum visit. These include (1) screening and referral for postpartum mood disorders (2) screening for cardiometabolic consequences of pregnancy complications, (3) discussing inter-conception care and (4) connecting women with a primary care provider. Thus, as recommended by numerous professional societies, the standard postpartum visit at 4 to 6 weeks after delivery has considerable value to women's postpartum care.

Attendance rates for the postpartum visit are markedly lower for women with limited resources contributing to racial and economic health disparities. Despite receiving excellent prenatal care, only 40% of the economically disadvantaged women who receive prenatal care at the Magee outpatient clinic return for their postpartum visit. These parallel national trends, where 60% of women with Medicaid insurance return for a postpartum checkup compared with over 82% of women with private insurance. Medicaid programs serve pregnant women who are particularly vulnerable to poor health outcomes and thus this gap is critical. Additionally, minority women disproportionally receive Medicaid and thus interventions that focus on Medicaid recipients have the potential to address racial as well as economic disparities. These data demonstrate that the current care model does not engage all women to make good health care decision postpartum and is disproportionately failing our most vulnerable moms and babies.

Empirically derived concepts from behavioral economics can be leveraged to design interventions that support participants to make better health decisions and may be particularly useful for postpartum care.

The feasibility trial will focus on four tenants of behavioral economics-bounded rationality (information overload), status quo bias (lack of self-control), hovering (limited attention), and framed incentives-- that have been successfully used to tackle stubborn health problems such as smoking and obesity. Importantly, unlike tobacco cessation or weight loss, many aspects of postpartum care such as compliance with the visit or uptake of LARC, do not require on-going action on part of the patient and thus may be particularly amenable to the lessons of behavioral economics.

Specific Aim 1: To conduct a pilot trial evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of a future randomized trial to determine the efficacy of Healthy Beyond Pregnancy on adherence with the postpartum visit.

NCT04915794,"['Preeclampsia', ""Nurse's Role""]",2020-07-18,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of simulation training in nurses and midwives on knowledge and self-efficacy regarding preeclamptic pregnancy care.

It is an important step in providing safe care to patients, as a learning environment is provided in which environmental risks are minimized with simulation applications. Simulation-based trainings are environments that allow each student to learn, equitable, based on adult learning principles, and open to different learning styles. The interests and needs in these environments are defined together by the learner and the educator. By keeping the experiences of the learner at the forefront, the opportunity is given to learn by doing and supported with feedback.

Preeclampsia is clinically defined as a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or above after the 20th week of pregnancy and the addition of proteinuria (300mg / 24 hours). It can develop in about 5-10% of all pregnancies. It is defined as a nulliparous disease since it is seen in approximately 85% of women during their first pregnancy. Preeclampsia constitutes 15% of the causes of maternal mortality in our country.

In studies evaluating the effectiveness of simulation training in planning the follow-up and care of preeclampsia, it was determined that this method increases the knowledge and self-confidence of nurses. For example; Christian and Krumwiede's study they found that the self-efficacy rates were significantly higher in the post-simulation test. In his study, Olubumno investigated the importance of simulation in increasing the critical thinking of perinatology nurses in the care of preeclamptic pregnant women, he found that the pre-test and post-test scores increased by 0.75 points, and this difference between the scores is statistically significant. Tabatabaeian et al., In their study comparing the effects of simulation-based education, coeducation and theoretical education on the performance of midwives in preeclampsia and eclampsia, found that the mean of the simulation group was higher than the other two groups.

Preeclampsia is an important obstetric emergency in women's health and disease nursing. Thus, when they start working in the clinic, it is aimed to be able to suspect preeclampsia with the anamnesis they received from the pregnant who applied to them, and to gain them with the simulation method what they should pay attention to and how to do in the follow-up of the pregnant woman hospitalized with the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Studies conducted in our country did not include studies involving students and healthcare professionals in the management of preeclampsia with simulation methods.

NCT02331160,['Breech Presentation'],2018-12-31,"Breech presentation occurs in approximately 3-5% of all pregnancies, and breech birth is more complicated and risky for the fetus than births of fetuses in the cephalic position.

Therefore, it is desirable to turn the fetus from breech presentation to cephalic position before labour. This is traditionally done by external cephalic version, where the doctor manually tries to turn the fetus; the success rate of this is approximately 50%, and complications occur in about 0.5%. In addition there is discomfort and pain to the pregnant woman.

The investigators will assess the effect of using the rebozo prior to the external version. Use of rebozo is a recognized technique from Mexico, where the midwife with a scarf 'shake' the pregnant woman's pelvis over several sessions, so the fetus spontaneously turns to cephalic presentation or the external version is facilitated.

There are no known complications associated with the rebozo method. Use of rebozo in breech presentation has never before been studied scientifically, but is used in many places in the world. The investigators are planning an open-labeled randomized controlled study in pregnancies with verified breech or transverse presentation: by lot either standard external cephalic version or preceding rebozo-treatment with subsequent external cephalic version.

The investigators want to assess whether the use of rebozo - either as pre-treatment for external cephalic version or as a catalyst of spontaneous version - will increase the incidence of the cephalic presentations at labour and thus reduce the number of planned caesarean section.

The population will be pregnant women with ultrasound verified breech or transverse presentation;all women who fulfill the local guideline criteria for external cephalic version, can be included. Exclusion criteria are non-Danish speaking or reading.

The recruitment will be conducted by midwife at week 35 in the antenatal care. The study design will be open-labeled randomized controlled. Randomisation is done by ""closed envelope method"" and stratified by parity. Intervention is rebozo exercises performed over 3-5 days from randomization. In case of persistent breech presentation, the woman is offered standard external cephalic version. The control group will also be offered external cephalic version after 3-5 days from randomization.

The investigators will use source data from existing local databases, ""Obstetrics Database"" and ""version Database"", for collecting birth outcome. In all stages of intervention documented electronically by project midwives.

The primary objective is the number of successful versions in total, i.e., after intervention and external cephalic version. We expect to increase the success rate from 50% to 65%, thus requiring 378 women in the study.

Secondary objectives are the number of successful vaginal births with birth in head position and total number of caesarean.",370,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

Of the 50% of adolescent mothers who experience depressive symptoms, less than 25% comply with referrals for depression evaluation and treatment due to lack of knowledge of depression symptoms (literacy), negative attitude towards mental health treatment, perception that individuals with depression are stigmatized (subjective norms), lack of understanding of health resources that are available to her and under her control (perceived control), and lack of time. Social media is a promising vehicle to reach and educate adolescent mothers since most adolescent mothers use social media for communication and to search for health information. Based upon the Theory of Planned Behavior, the investigators will target 11 counties in Kentucky with a social media ad campaign that will result in adolescent mothers (n=140) from those counties enrolling in an internet based intervention related to postpartum depression. The previously tested intervention includes vignettes from other adolescent mothers, questions and answers, resources, and an option to enroll in text message service. Before the intervention, after the intervention, and two weeks later the adolescent mothers will complete established questionnaires to determine if the intervention improved attitude and subjective norms towards depression and depression treatment, perceived control and intention related to seeking depression treatment, and the number of adolescent mothers with symptoms of depression who receive depression treatment.

NCT04077060,['Aneuploidy'],2020-01-15,"There is an ongoing debate regarding how cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening can best be incorporated into current prenatal screening algorithms for chromosomal abnormalities.

Test performance of cfDNA has been shown to be better that first-trimester combined screening (FTCS). However, the cost of the cfDNA testing is considered too high to adopt as first line screening. Moreover, FTCS includes a detailed ultrasound examination of the fetus with nuchal translucency (NT) measurement that allows for early detection of fetal abnormalities.

An approach in which every woman are offered an early anatomy scan along with cfDNA may also be a reasonable option. Recently a randomized controlled trial, including 1,518 women with singleton pregnancy undergoing first-trimester screening, compared the screening performance of FTCS with an approach that uses the combination of a detailed ultrasound examination and cfDNA analysis. The trial showed that first-trimester risk assessment for trisomy 21 that includes a detailed ultrasound examination along cfDNA was associated with a significant reduction in the false-positive rate compared with FTCS. This approach obviates the need for maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A in screening for fetal aneuploidy.

During this period, and after the establishment of Menopause and non-functioning ovarian, the appearance of various symptoms that express the depletion of ovarian follicles is common; among these symptoms, the most frequently reported by women are vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes. In addition to hormonal therapy, other medications have been employed in an attempt to improve these symptoms; although they present better results than placebo, yet have little clinical impact in reducing vasomotor symptoms. Therefore, this gap allows the evaluation of alternative therapies, such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). The rationale for studying the effect of this technique in this context is its possible autonomic modulatory effect. What reinforces the choice of this technique is the fact that it demonstrated efficacy in other pathologies such as depression, pain, Parkinson's disease, among others. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a renewed method of non-invasive brain modulation. It is based on a transcranial application of weak direct currents in a non-invasive, simple and painless manner. Its use in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms has not been studied.

NCT01625091,['HIV Infection'],2016-07,"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether an intervention that involves the medication naltrexone, will reduce drinking and improve health outcomes in women with HIV infection and hazardous drinking. Our central hypotheses are that, compared to women who receive placebo (sugar pill containing no medicine), women who receive naltrexone will have decreased rates of hazardous drinking, improved HIV medication adherence, less rapid disease progression, and reduced sexual risk behavior. The study design will involve 240 HIV-infected women with hazardous drinking, who will be recruited from HIV clinics, neighborhoods and referrals in Miami, Florida.

Eligible women will receive either a daily pill containing naltrexone (50mg) or an identical-appearing placebo for four months. All participants will receive encouragement and feedback related to their drinking regardless of medication assignment. The study participants will be assessed at two, four and seven months after enrollment. The proposed work is innovative because pharmacologic treatment for alcohol has not been evaluated in HIV-infected women. If our hypotheses are confirmed, the study findings would transform the approach to hazardous drinking within clinics serving HIV-infected women.",194,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

NCT00034060,"['Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Healthy']",N/A,"This study has two phases. Phase 1 will examine the role of inflammatory mediators called cytokines on growth hormone levels in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Phase 2 will evaluate the effect of etanercept on these growth hormone levels. Etanercept is approved for the treatment of RA. It lowers the levels of a key inflammatory mediator called tumor necrosis factor-alpha and is very effective in reducing arthritis symptoms.

Growth hormone promotes bone and muscle growth. With aging, people lose muscle mass and bone strength, possibly because of decreased levels of growth hormone. People with RA have bone and muscle changes similar to those in older people, perhaps also due to decreased levels of growth hormone. The first part of this study will see if the inflammatory mediators responsible for joint inflammation (warmth, redness, pain, and swelling) in RA are related to the lowered growth hormone levels in this disease. The second part will evaluate the effect of etanercept treatment on muscle mass and bone density, in addition to growth hormone levels.

Premenopausal women between 18 and 55 years of age with a recent diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (less than 3 years) are eligible for this study. Healthy volunteers will also be enrolled in the first phase of the study as control subjects. This study is conducted at two sites, the NIH and the Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore.

Healthy volunteers enrolled in this study will be interviewed about their health status and will fill out questionnaires on diet and general physical function, including fatigue, energy and well being. In addition, they will be hospitalized once at the NIH Clinical Center for 24-hour blood sampling and will visit to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore for a brachial artery reactivity study, as follows:

* 24-hour blood sampling for growth hormone levels. Blood samples (1/2 teaspoon each) will be collected every 20 minutes from 8 AM one day until 8 AM the following day through a plastic tube in an arm vein.
* Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan on a small area of the spine, hip and wrist to assess bone density and a total body DEXA scan to assess the amount and distribution of muscle and body fat.
* Blood vessel (brachial artery reactivity) study to measure the ability of the brachial artery to dilate and increase its blood flow. For this procedure, the subject lies on a table with electrocardiogram leads attached to the chest. A blood pressure cuff is inflated for several minutes and a drop of nasal spray of nitroglycerin is given that may cause a headache. Blood pressure and headache are monitored and treated as needed.

Background: Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women in Uganda. Although effective tools for prevention and control of malaria exist, their delivery presents a problem. Intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is effective, yet \>60% of women in Uganda do not get it as \< 40%, attend antenatal care. Effective ways of delivering IPT with SP to pregnant women at a community level need to be developed. This study assessed whether community based resource persons like traditional birth attendants (TBAs), community reproductive health workers (CRHWs), adolescent peer mobilizers (APMs) and drug-shop owners (DSV) can distribute IPT with SP to pregnant women.

Objectives: The objectives of this study were:

* To assess community based approaches for delivering malaria prevention to pregnant women in Uganda;
* To assess community perceptions, beliefs and practices associated with malaria treatment and prevention in pregnancy;
* To assess whether community based resource persons can deliver IPT to pregnant women and reach those most at risk;
* To assess the impact of IPT on anaemia and pregnancy outcome;
* To estimate cost-effectiveness of the approaches and assess the acceptability and sustainability of the approaches.

Methods: The study was conducted in 5 sub-counties of the Mukono district, situated on the shores of L. Victoria in Central Uganda. The district is hyper-endemic for malaria. 25 parishes with a total population of 75,000 people were used to test the new approaches. Phase 1 obtained qualitative data on community perceptions, beliefs and practices associated with malaria prevention in pregnancy. Phase 2 was an intervention study that assessed distribution of IPT to pregnant women by TBAs, CRHWs, APMs and DSVs compared with health units. Pregnant women of all parities were enrolled. Key resource persons in each parish were identified to sensitise the communities on the intervention. Data was collected regarding: timing of the first dose of SP, proportion of women who complete two doses of SP, birth weight of babies, proportion of low birth-weight babies, and proportion of adolescent pregnancies. The third phase of the study evaluated the sustainability of the approaches.

Work Plan: The first phase of the study took two months. The second phase took 14-16 months. Data analysis was expected to take 12 months.",2150,FEMALE,N/A,N/A

NCT00810927,"['Physiology, Ocular', 'Microcirculation', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Autoregulation']",2004-02,"Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure. For a long time it had been assumed that the choroid is a strictly passive vascular bed, which shows no autoregulation. However, recently several groups have identified some autoregulatory capacity of the human choroid. In the brain and the retina the mechanism behind autoregulation is most likely linked to changes in transmural pressure. In this model arterioles change their vascular tone depending on the pressure inside the vessel and outside the vessel. In the choroid, several observations argue against a direct involvement of arterioles. However, the mechanism behind choroidal autoregulation remains unclear.

In the present study autoregulation of the choroid will be investigated during a decrease in ocular perfusion pressure, which will be achieved by an increase in intraocular pressure. Pressure/flow relationships will be investigated in the absence or presence of a NO synthase inhibitor.

NCT02495727,['Muscular Atrophy'],2017-10,"Muscle size declines at around 0.5-1% per year after 50 years of age, with muscle strength declining up to twice as fast as muscle size. This may eventually lead to loss of independence if tasks of daily living become too strenuous to be performed safely. Short periods of bed rest cause very rapid loss of muscle size and strength, and studies using healthy older participants have shown that age increases vulnerability to this muscle loss. However, it is unlikely that healthy individuals would be faced with periods of bed rest unless suffering a severe illness. In light of this, recent evidence has shown that even just reducing walking to less than 1,500 steps per day for two weeks caused 4% loss of leg muscle in over 65 year olds. This amount of activity is roughly the equivalent of being housebound, something that may become more common into older age, for example due to prolonged bad weather, or minor injury or illness.

This study will investigate what causes such stark muscle loss during two weeks of reduced activity, and the impact on skeletal muscle function and size, as well as balance, body composition, and other indicators of general health such as how the body responds to food or exercise. Importantly, exercise strategies that could reduce muscle loss during a period of reduced activity will also be investigated.

In brief, three groups of 10 older men (aged 65-80 years) will undertake two weeks of reduced physical activity by limiting their daily steps to \<1,500/day. All groups will then undertake a re-training exercise programme to ensure that any losses in muscle strength or size are regained. One of the groups will be a control, whereby they will undertake the step-reduction intervention and re-training, but no protective exercise before or during the step-reduction intervention. This group will allow us to achieve our primary objective of determining the influence of two weeks of reduced physical activity on muscle strength and size in healthy older males. The two other groups will undertake either four weeks of strength exercise training before the step-reduction intervention, or daily home based exercise 'snacking' during the step-reduction intervention. The potential protective benefits of the exercise interventions in reducing the impact of two weeks of reduced activity on muscle strength and size, and any effect on how muscle is re-gained afterwards, will be compared to the 'control' group.",12,MALE,65 Years,80 Years

NCT03658694,['Fibromyalgia'],2023-03-01,"There are currently several points concerning rTMS for pain relief that have a huge impact in the practical application of rTMS in clinical practice, but which have not been approached by previous studies. Also, an even more important issue is the frequency of the sessions in each treatment protocol. The idea of performing stimulation in chronic pain patients on a consecutive daily basis for long-term treatments seem unrealistic and potentially costly. However, it has been reported in animals, healthy subjects and FM patients that the analgesic effects of rTMS can outlast the stimulation session for several minutes and even days. This has led to the proposal that pain treatment with rTMS could be performed in consecutive daily induction sessions, followed by spaced (weekly, fortnightly and even monthly) maintenance sessions. This approach is similar to what is performed routinely in patients with major depression treated by rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and has successfully been tested in FM patients in a single- center study. Should this approach prove effective in larger prospective multicentric studies, rTMS could enter the armamentarium of non-invasive, non- pharmacological, low-adverse event therapeutic options to relieve fibromyalgia- related pain and associate symptoms. Hence, our aim is to conduct a multicentric international clinical trial on the influence of rTMS in the control of pain in a consecutive adaptive trial design where conventional rTMS (10Hz) and patterned rTMS (theta-burst) will be studied. Stimulations will be performed in a clinical practice-friendly approach, where daily maintenance sessions will be followed by weekly, and fortnightly stimulation sessions. There have been very scarce adaptive trials in the pain and non-invasive stimulation fields.

NCT02811276,['Dietary Modification'],2018-03,"In the 19th century, researchers found out that the differences in the energy content of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate and fat) can elicit different responses in the amount of calories individuals burn per day. It was demonstrated that protein has a metabolic advantage when compared to the other macronutrients (carbohydrate and fat). Since these findings, researchers all over the world started to study how diets differing in macronutrient distribution could result in different responses to energy metabolism. Diets with high amounts of protein (i.e. meats, eggs, dairy products, and grains) are becoming more popular, and studies have shown that when people eat high quantities of protein they lose weight and fat mass, maintain the weight loss, and burn more calories per day.

The investigators hypothesize that giving high amounts of protein to healthy women will increase the amount of calories and fat they burn per day, increase their satiety, and improve health markers when compared to a normal diet. The increased protein level will be achieved using a nutrition supplement consisted of soy protein, yogurt and honey.

To test this, the investigators plan to divide the participants in two groups: one will eat a normal diet and the other a diet with high amounts of protein during one and a half day. After one month they will change groups and eat the other diet for the same period of time. During this period consuming the diets (1.5 days), participants will stay inside a whole body calorimetry suite, which is similar to a hotel bedroom and is able to inform in the most precise way the amount of calories participants will burn and if they are burning more fat.

NCT04729491,['Covid19'],2020-09-15,"During the continuing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies have reported a significant difference in the rate of severe cases between adult females and adult males (42% vs 58%). Among children under the age of 14, the rate of severe cases was reported to be extremely low. To explain this difference, several theories have been proposed including cigarette smoking and lifestyle habits. However, no theory fits both the gender difference in severe cases as well as reduced risk in pre-pubescent children. Our past research on male androgenetic alopecia (AGA) has led us to investigate an association between androgens and COVID-19 pathogenesis. In normal subjects, androgen expression demonstrates significant variation between men and women as well as between adults and pre-pubescent children.

SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects type II pneumocytes in the human lung. SARS-CoV-2 enters pneumocytes, by anchoring to the ACE2 cell surface receptor. Prior to receptor binding, viral spike proteins undergo proteolytic priming by the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). TMPRSS2 inhibition or knock down reduces ability of SARS-CoV-1 (a related virus to SARS-CoV-2) to infect cells in vitro. Additionally, TMPRSS2 also facilitates entry of influenza A and influenza B into primary human airway cells and type II pneumocytes.

The human TMPRSS2 gene has a 15 bp androgen response element and in humans, androgens are the only known transcription promoters for the TMPRSS2 gene. In a study of androgen-stimulated prostate cancer cells (LNCaP), TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increase was mediated by the androgen receptor.10 Further, the ACE2 receptor, also critical for SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity, is affected by male sex hormones with higher activity found in males.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), often referred to as male pattern hair loss, is the most common form of hair loss among men. The development of androgenetic alopecia is androgen mediated and is dependent on genetic variants found in the androgen receptor gene located on the X chromosome. We hypothesized that men with AGA would be more prone to severe COVID-19 disease. We conducted a preliminary observational study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at two Spanish tertiary hospitals between March 23-April 6, 2020 to test this theory. In total, 41 Caucasian males admitted to the hospitals with a diagnosis of bilateral SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 58 years (range 23-79). Among them, 29 (71%) were diagnosed with AGA (16 (39%) were classified as severe AGA (Hamilton IV or above)) and 12 (29%) did not present clinical signs of AGA. The diagnosis of AGA was performed clinically by a dermatologist. The precise prevalence of AGA among otherwise healthy Spanish Caucasian males is unknown; however, based on published literature, the expected prevalence of a similar age-matched Caucasian population is approximately 31-53%.

Further, according to the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-rapid-risk-assessment-coronavirus-disease-2019-eighth-update-8-april-2020.pdf): ""Of the confirmed cases in China, 3.8% (1 716/44 672) were healthcare workers. Of those, 14.8% were severely or critically ill and 5% of the severe cases died. Latest figures reported from Italy show that 9% of COVID-19 cases are healthcare workers, with Lombardy region reporting up to 20% of cases in healthcare workers. In Spain, the latest COVID-19 situation overview from the Ministry of Health reports that 26% of COVID-19 cases are in healthcare workers. In a Dutch study, healthcare workers were tested voluntarily for COVID-19 and 6% tested positive. In a report on 30 cases in healthcare workers in China, all cases had a history of direct contact (distance within 1 metre) with COVID-19 patients, with an average number of 12 contacts, and the average cumulative contact time being two hours (1.5, 2.7). In the Dutch study, only 3% of the healthcare workers reported being exposed to hospital patients with COVID-19 prior onset of symptoms and 63% had worked while asymptomatic.

Based on the scientific rationale combined with this preliminary observation, we propose to test an anti-androgen as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This study is intended to explore the possible protective role of anti-androgens in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including reduction of virological duration and disease severity.",138,MALE,18 Years,N/A

NCT02658994,['Depression'],2019-08-01,"Background

The negative effects of perinatal depression on mother and child start early and persist throughout the life-course. Given that 10-35% of children worldwide are exposed to perinatal depression in their first year of life, 16 mitigating this intergenerational risk is a global public health priority. However, there is a dearth of studies on whether a maternal depression intervention can have long-term benefits for either the mother or her child. This is a study of the effectiveness of an extended 36-month peer-delivered depression intervention, the Thinking Healthy Programme PLUS (THPP+) for women and their children in rural Pakistan.

Study Design

The THPP+ study aims to evaluate the effects of an extended 36-month perinatal depression intervention on mother and child outcomes using a cluster randomized controlled trial (c-RCT) design. The trial will recruit 560 pregnant women who screened positive for perinatal depression (PHQ-9 \>=10) from 40 village clusters, of which 20 clusters will receive the THPP+ intervention delivered by trained peers. These women will have already been participating in the trial of the shorter, 6 month long, version of the intervention.

Opioids (which are the analgesic of choice) have many adverse effects such as sedation, nausea, and vomiting. Hence, different methods are needed to control pain and decrease opioid consumption and its side effects.

Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block blocks the sensory afferent nerves run between the abdominal muscles and controls postoperative incisional pain.

Blanco was the first who described the quadratus lumborum block (QLB). Somatic pain after upper and lower abdominal surgery can be controlled by QLB. QLB can be performed for all generations (adult, pediatrics, and pregnant).

QLB is considered to be an easy technique to learn as it is easy to get the key sonoanatomic markers for QLB. The novice can learn this block after only a few performance of the procedure. QLB produces effective postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery, laparoscopic surgery, anterior abdominal wall surgery, and hip and femur surgery. The analgesic effect of QLB covers 24-48 h. While some authors inserted catheter for continuous infusion of the local anesthetic drug to extend the duration of postoperative analgesia, others added dexamethasone to local anesthetic to extend the effect of local anesthetic drugs.

The study will recruit HIV infected women who take Efavirenz as part of their anti-hiv treatment and who are pregnant.

Efavirenz has been shown to be safe in pregnancy and at the standard dose that everybody takes of 600mg once a day, it shows levels that are enough to treat HIV and give birth to a HIV negative baby.

Efavirenz at a dose of 400mg once daily works against HIV too but this dose has not been given to HIV positive pregnant women.

People with HIV may benefit from using a dose of efavirenz of 400mg instead of 600mg, as lower drug doses could have fewer side effects and be tolerated better.

Dose reduction would also make the drug cheaper. This would allow more people to be treated and free up money for other important work in the fight against HIV such as education and prevention programs.

However, it is not known whether 400mg of Efavirenz works as well as 600mg of Efavirenz during pregnancy and this is why the investigators are conducting this study, which aims to measure the amount of Efavirenz 400mg in HIV pregnant women's bodies when they are taking 400mg of Efavirenz once a day.",26,FEMALE,18 Years,45 Years

The most frequent complaint is that of itchiness of the vulva but pain may also occur. Some women will experience no symptoms at all. However, it is important to treat this condition since it may increase and cause important scarring and deformity. In less than 5% of cases, cancer may develop.

Lichen Sclerosus is a chronic disease which can be controlled but not cured. Topical corticosteroids are the usual treatment for this condition. Though this treatment is generally well tolerated, some patients may not present a sufficient response or may develop mainly local and rarely systemic side effects. In this perspective, an alternative treatment would be beneficial.

Tacrolimus, a topical immunomodulator has been approved for the treatment of atopic eczema and has shown its efficacy in the treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus in a limited number of patients. Tacrolimus acts as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAI) without causing the usual side effects seen with the prolonged use of topical corticosteroids.

NCT04754282,['Epidural Analgesia for Labour and Delivery'],2022-03-26,"The success of an epidural analgesia catheter placement depends on the parturient position. A poor posture can increase the number of punctures, patient discomfort, and risk of complications. An adequate position reverses lumbar lordosis, facilitating the access to the intervertebral space. In most cases, insertion of the epidural analgesia catheter is performed in sitting position or in lateral decubitus, the choice being generally guided by the preference of the anesthetist.

According to anesthetists' experience in the obstetrical anesthesia unit at Necker-Enfants Malades hospital, a cross-legged sitting position is comfortable for parturients, restricts interfering movements during the procedure, and provides adequate widening of interspinous spaces. This position results in knees and hips flexion, tilting the pelvis backward and opening the interspinous spaces, while limiting muscular strain to maintain the position.

One in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. With improved screening and treatment techniques, more women are surviving breast cancer. However, women live with physical and emotional side effects secondary to treatment for years after cancer treatments have ended. Exercise can help to manage these side effects, however, less than 30% of this population takes part in regular exercise. The objective of this trial is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel exercise and education program for women with breast cancer during chemotherapy.

METHODS:

Participants in this study include women with a diagnosis of stage 1 - 3 breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Women will be divided into three groups. The first group will include 8 sessions of exercise and self-management education during their chemotherapy treatment. The second group will receive self-management education only, and the third group will receive usual care. Outcomes will be compared between groups at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6- and 12- month follow up. Outcomes to be assessed include exercise level, functional mobility, muscle strength, quality of life, health status, and use of health care services.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:

Women with breast cancer are among the least active segment of the Canadian population.

NCT05538520,"['Young Adults', 'Performance', 'Exercise']",2022-11-25,"Introduction: The practice of stretching is commonly used in the preparation of activities and/or physical exercises that require some component of flexibility, strength, endurance and muscle power. This explains the high growth in recent decades of studies investigating the effect of stretching, mainly static and dynamic, when performed immediately before activities that aim to develop these physical capacities. Despite the growing interest of scholars on this topic, the long-term impact of dynamic stretching on flexibility, strength performance, endurance and muscle power is still not fully understood. In addition, a type of dynamic stretching little explored in the literature needs investigation: the stretches used during Pilates exercise sessions. The effects of these stretching exercises on a physical conditioning program based on Pilates exercises in the young adult population are not yet known. Objective: To verify through a randomized clinical trial the effects of stretching in a conditioning program based on Pilates exercises on flexibility, strength, endurance and muscle power. Methods: In this study, 32 young adults of both sexes will be randomized into two groups: 1) Traditional Pilates; 2) Pilates Without Stretching. The Traditional Pilates group will perform a protocol of stretching exercises followed by muscle strengthening. The Pilates Without Stretching group will perform an exercise protocol consisting only of muscle strengthening exercises.

NCT01599520,"['Cancer', 'Stress']",2016-09-01,"Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy experience a number of aversive symptoms that are accompanied by declines in physical and mental well-being. Although the benefits of stress management training interventions on quality of life are well documented, there are no published studies examining the efficacy of these interventions among Hispanic women and Latinas (hereafter referred to as Latinas) receiving chemotherapy. This dearth of research reflects the general lack of stress management interventions for cancer patients whose preferred language is Spanish. Simply translating existing English-language interventions into Spanish may seem to be a solution for the lack of Spanish-language stress management interventions. This approach, however, does not take into account cultural values, beliefs and situational realities that are likely to contribute to patients' uptake of health promoting behaviors. The proposed research seeks to address this gap by evaluating a stress management training intervention developed specifically for Latinas beginning chemotherapy for cancer.

In response to the identified need, the investigators created a Spanish-Language Self-Administered Stress Management Training (SL-SAT) intervention ""Cómo tratar el estrés durante la quimioterapia"" (""How to manage stress during chemotherapy""). The intervention is based on an English-language self-administered stress management training intervention the investigators previously developed and showed to be efficacious in a randomized controlled trial. Development of the Spanish-language intervention was the result of extensive use of ethnographic and learner verification methods, guided by a community-based participatory research approach. Similar to the English-language version, the SL-SAT intervention consists of a digital video disc(DVD), booklet, and audio compact disc (CD), and provides instruction in three well-established stress management techniques: deep breathing; progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery; and use of coping self-statements.

NCT00539474,['Breast Cancer'],2010-06,"Rationale:

Approximately 25% of breast cancers detected are non palpable. Accordingly, a localization technique is required to help the surgeon to find and remove the cancer. The current technique (wire guided localization \[WGL\]) is difficult to perform and has a high rate of tumour positive margins in the resected specimen, requiring a second operation. A new approach in the localization and resection of non-palpable malignant breast lesions is 'radio guided occult lesion localization' (ROLL). ROLL was introduced as a possible replacement for WGL at the 'European Institute of Oncology' in Milan in 1996. This technique utilizes the intratumourally injected radiotracer, that is generally used for the lymphatic mapping and SNB, to localize the primary tumour guided by the gamma probe. Five studies so far have proven the applicability of this method.

Objective:

To evaluate the efficacy of Radio Occult Lesion Localisation (ROLL) versus Wire guided Localisation (WGL) in breast conserving surgery for non-palpable breast cancer

Study design:

A multicenter, prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients with proven non-palpable breast cancer will be randomized for either ROLL or WGL.

Study population:

316 women with a core biopsy proven non palpable cT1 breast carcinoma that are eligible for a breast conserving treatment and sentinel node biopsy (SNB).

Intervention (if applicable):

Patients in the WGL group will undergo intra tumoural injection of a nuclear radiotracer under stereotactic or ultrasonographic guidance. After scintigraphic imaging, to monitor the migration of the radiotracer, a guide wire will be inserted under stereotactic or ultrasonographic guidance. The excision of the primary tumour is guided by the inserted wire and the sentinel node procedure is performed using a gamma probe and intratumoural injection of patent blue.

Patients in the ROLL group will undergo the same procedure except for the guide wire insertion. The excision of the primary tumour is guided by the gamma probe.

Main study parameters/endpoints:

Primary study endpoints; ROLL vs WGL:

1. The percentage of tumour-free margins (invasive and in situ)
2. The volume and maximum diameter of the lumpectomy

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:

There is no pre-, per- or post operative extra burden. The radiofarmacon is already used in the standard care of breast cancer patients for the sentinel node biopsy. The used radio-active substance does not damage the patient.

A specific burden questionnaire, aimed at evaluating the burden of the cosmetic result, will be administered. To further assess the net impact in terms of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) also the EQ5D will be obtained at T = 0, 6, 12 and 26 weeks after the initial diagnostic work-up.

Should the results indicate that overall the WGL procedure lead to better clinical outcome a cost-effectiveness analysis is foreseen using bootstrapping to assess the uncertainty with regard to the balance between costs and effects. All analyses will be limited to a half year time horizon. Accordingly, discounting of costs or effects is not applicable.",316,FEMALE,18 Years,N/A

NCT00136682,['Postoperative Pain'],2007-07,"Recovery after major abdominal surgery can be longer than other types of surgery. This is because often after abdominal surgery, the bowel does not work normally. When this happens, patients are unable to pass gas. This can lead to bloating, pain, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms are called postoperative ileus.

We, the researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), are doing this study to compare two methods of treating pain during and after major gynecological surgery. The two methods are called patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA). PCA is the standard of care for women having major gynecological surgery. We are going to compare PCEA to PCA to see if PCEA will improve recovery after major gynecologic surgery.

PCEA is a well established method used to ease pain in many settings such as during childbirth and bowel surgery. There have been several studies showing that PCEA is as good as and sometimes better for pain relief than PCA. PCEA may help the bowel work better by preventing ileus after surgery.

The investigators will use nucleic acid testing to screen 750 behaviorally high-risk MSM for rectal gonorrheal and/or chlamydial (GC/CT) infection. GC/CT-positive subjects will receive single-dose antibiotic treatment and single-session Personal Cognitive Counseling (PCC) (n=50) or standard post-test counseling (n=50). A GC/CT-negative control group (n=50) will also be enrolled to compare biological outcomes including changes in levels of inflammatory cytokines following rectal STI. The intervention is based on three interrelated objectives: 1) To use periodic rectal STI nucleic acid testing to identify the members of the MSM population at greatest short-term risk for HIV infection; 2) To provide single-dose antibiotic treatment to control the immune activation and mucosal inflammation caused by rectal GC/CT infection that increase cellular risk for HIV transmission; and 3) To use Personal Cognitive Counseling (PCC) to understand and modify recent high-risk sexual practices that led to rectal STI acquisition and that increase future HIV risk.

The investigators propose to screen 750 behaviorally high-risk MSM for rectal GC/CT infection to enroll 100 GC/CT-positive individuals (using a conservative 15% prevalence estimate) and 50 GC/CT-negative controls (matched by age and baseline frequency of URAI). GC/CT-infected participants will be given single-dose antibiotic therapy and randomized to receive single-session PCC (n=50) or standard post-test counseling (n=50).

When a pregnancy is complicated by a diagnosis of AL, clinicians face a complex dilemma: to balance risking the mother's survival through delaying treatment, against the potential harm to the foetus through exposure to cancer drugs. Reports suggest that, providing the first trimester is avoided, successful treatment of AL during pregnancy is possible, and considered safe. However, there is currently no standard approach to treatment of these women.

This observational study aims to monitor and record the current treatment and outcomes of patients diagnosed with acute leukaemia during or prior to pregnancy.

NCT05149131,['Metastatic Castration-sensitive Prostate Cancer'],2022-08-16,"This is an observational study in which patient data from the past on men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer is studied.

Metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is a type of advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, and still responds to treatment that lowers testosterone levels.

Cancer is a condition in which the body cannot control the growth of cells. The extra cells can form tumors in organs or other parts of the body. If tumors form in the prostate, male hormones (androgens) can sometimes help the cancer spread and grow. The main hormone that does this is called testosterone and is mainly made in the testicles. Men with prostate cancer can have treatments to try to lower the levels of testosterone in the body. One possible treatment is surgery to remove the testicles. Another option is taking treatments to lower the levels of testosterone in the body. These are called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In men with mCSPC, ADT can help to stop the cancer from growing and spreading. Men with mCSPC can also receive ""treatment intensification"". This means that they receive ADT as well as other treatments for their prostate cancer. Other studies that looked at treatment of mCSPC in Canada have found that most men with mCSPC do not receive treatment intensification.

In this study, the researchers want to collect more data about the men who had mCSPC and the types of treatment they received for their mCSPC. The researchers will look at the health information of adult men in Alberta, Canada who had at least 1 dose of treatment for their mCSPC between January 2016 and December 2020 or earlier.

The study will first look at the health information of men whose cancer had metastasized or spread to other parts of the body, beyond the prostate, at the time they were diagnosed with prostate cancer.

And later, if feasible to do, the study may also look at the health information from men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer that was limited to the prostate, and over time spread to other parts of the body.

The researchers will collect information from databases, a census, and pharmacy records. This will help the researchers learn more about:

* whether the men received ADT alone, or ADT with treatment intensification
* additional information about the men, including their age, income, level of education, residential area (urban or rural) and the more information about the treatments received
* how the men's symptoms affected their daily lives
* how severe the men's cancer was
* changes in laboratory values as markers for changes to the blood, liver, kidney, bone or other organs
* need for additional treatment
* where the men's cancer may have spread to in other parts of the body.
